US,"A beautiful Cabernet that shows the promise of this Lake County appellation.

US,"A big Cabernet, impenetrably dark in color and tannicly closed. It has ripe, juicy blackberry, cassis liqueur and dark chocolate flavors, with a jacket of sweet, toasted oak. It needs time for those tannins to resolve, so give it a good eight years in the bottle.",92,50,California,Calistoga,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A big wine for Merlot, this high alcohol (14.6%) effort ramps up its black cherry fruit with volatile acidity and brings in chocolaty barrel flavors under an earthy, tannic finish.

The joy ride ends with a balanced sense of wet stone, fresh and refined.",91,60,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
US,"A big, dry wine rich in red fruit and sizable tannins, this 100% varietal, single-vineyard designated offering is buoyed by silky, fine-grained tannins that support its voluptuous nature. More savory than sweet in terms of ripeness, its flavors lean toward tobacco and black tea. Drink now through 2022.",93,125,California,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A big, extracted and, as currently constructed, somewhat ponderous wine that's not showing all that well. Could simply be immature, but it does seem to lack a certain vibrancy. Other than that, it's powerful in blackberry, black cherry and oak flavors, accompanied by strong tannins. Could surprise after, say, 2014.",89,90,California,St. Helena,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A big, flashy wine that's fabulously rich in flavors of pineapple, orange and lemon custard, and liberally accented with the cr√®me br√ªl√©e and vanilla from it's time in new French oak. Fresh acidity, minerality from the soil and a dry finish bring an elegant touch to this ripe Chardonnay.",92,40,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay

US,"A big, juicy, fruit-bomb of a ros√©, this Knight's Gambit from Erath mixes flavors of rosewater, watermelon, strawberries and cocoa in a big, broad, forward, palate-pleasing wine. The pretty pink color is from skin contact with the Pinot Gris‚Äîno red wine was added.",88,22,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Gris

US,"A big, vital and important Cabernet that deserves a place in the cellar. It hits the mouth with huge tannins that are tight and locked down, yet sweetly ripe. That contradiction persists throughout the fantastically complex blackberry, cherry, currant and mocha flavors. A very fine, superior wine that exemplifies the Stags Leap iron fist in a velvet glove. As delicious as it is, you should hold this Cabernet for a good six years, and it could easily develop for an additional decade.",96,89,California,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A big, vital wine, mouth-filling and dense, with plenty of weight and volume, and deep flavors of earth, chocolate, blackberry and sweet currant. The cool '09 vintage has resulted in this version of Cask 23 being lighter in alcohol and tighter than others like the 2008. It's not quite as fat or immediately accessible as those vintages, but it is very fine, and should reward at least 10 years in the cellar, although you can certainly drink it now after a few hours in the decanter.",94,210,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"A bit earthy. One hundred percent new oak dominates the jammy black cherry, violet and herb flavors. Feels somewhat tired, even though it's only three-plus years old.",87,80,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A bit firmer and more powerful than the producer's regular bottling, the Vintner's Select boasts a core of black cherry and cassis accented by shades of bramble and forest floor. Rich, rounded and full bodied, it's balanced by a streak of cranberry acidity and lingering notes of anise.",89,45,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Merlot
US,"A bit harsh in acids and sharp tannins, this Merlot offers earthy, herbal cherry and currant flavors, rounded off with smoky oak influences. Drink now.",84,29,California,Bennett Valley,Merlot

US,"A bit on the lean side, with apple and citrus flavors, which are typical of the appellation. Acidity is also sharp and mouth-watering.

US,"A bit on the light-bodied side, but nice and dry, with plenty of personality. The flavors are of briary, brambly wild blackberries, raspberries and blueberries, dusted with black pepper and cinnamon.",86,20,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
US,"A bit on the sugary side, making it not truly dry, but adequate acidity provides balance to the very rich pineapple, pear, fig and honeysuckle flavors. Great with Vietnamese or Chinese fare.",84,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"A bit quick on the finish, but otherwise a nice everyday Chardonnay. Shows a soft, buttercream texture, with dry, subtle flavors of pineapples, pears and buttered toast.",85,13,California,Alexander Valley,Chardonnay
US,"A bit rough and angular, with a jagged tannic structure that suggests not all the grapes were completely ripe. With blackberry, cherry and mint flavors, the wine is at its best now.",84,39,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A bit rugged in texture, with some jagged tannins, but the blackberry and cherry fruit is just fine, and the finish is dry and complex. Decant this young wine for a few hours to take the edge off.",87,28,California,Napa Valley,Merlot

US,"A bit rustic and heavy, with extracted jammy fruit but lacking a certain vivacity and sharpness in the mouth. Good enough for the price. Production was 12,500 cases.",86,19,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel
US,"A bit rustic and rowdy, in the way of Malbec, with big, edgy tannins and a scour of acidity. Whatever elegance it lacks, it makes up for in the sheer power of its blackberry and coffee fruit flavors. Will probably age forever, gradually mellowing and sweetening, without ever showing much complexity.",87,42,California,Sonoma Valley,Malbec
US,"A bit shy on the nose, this eventually shows red currants and sour plum-skin aromas. The palate is also reluctant at first, with purple fruit and black-pepper flavors.",85,48,California,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A bit simple, but definitely not shy on flavor, bursting with melon and pear fruit. It's an attempt at an Alsatian style, full and weighty in the mouth, and showing a trace of heat on the finish.",87,18,California,Sonoma County,Pinot Gris
US,"A bit sweet and rugged, with jammy blackberry, currant and pepper spice flavors wrapped into firm tannins. Shows Zin's briary, brambly character.",85,36,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
US,"A bit thin and acidic, but charming for its dryness and firm tannins, which call for rich, marbled beef. The pepper-inspired blackberry and cassis flavors are fine. Not an ager, but will benefit from a few hours of decanting.",87,30,California,California,Zinfandel
US,"A bit too brittle and tart to earn a higher score. Could be bottle shock, but it's hard to tell. Tasted in May, the wine showed mint-infused cherry flavors and turned sharp on the finish. Made from 100% Grenache.",85,32,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Grenache

US,"A complex opening of leather, plum, vanilla and gingerbread leads to a crisp palate with intense cherry notes. Lacks the multi-dimensionality of a top wine but the touches of youthful fruit on the medium finish are guaranteed to charm. Drink now.",87,20,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Merlot
US,"A complex, sophisticated Zinfandel, although it's very young, and all the parts haven't come together. Shows luscious waves of ripe forest blackberries, raspberries, red plums and nectarines, with notes of dry chocolate, sweet tobacco, balsam and cedar, finished with massive peppery spices. Notable for the purity and elegance of its tannin-acid structure, this beautiful Zinfandel should age well through 2014.",94,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
US,"A concentrated white peach element plays strongly on the nose of this coveted bottling, with touches of sea salt and a sharp tangerine-like edge. Ripe peach and cherimoya flavors show on the palate, but a crescendoing citrus-driven acidity cuts through the richness and allows more savory components like salt and smoked nut to blossom on the finish.",93,60,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"A consistent standout among Newsome-Harlow's stellar lineup of single-vineyard Zins, The Donner Party is rich in blackberry liqueur and licorice, finely structured and soft in tannins, with a dusty, mocha-lined finish and just the right seasoning of leather. Blended with 12% Petite Sirah.",93,36,California,Calaveras County,Zinfandel
US,"A consistent standout for this winery, the new vintage does not disappoint. Jazzy and jammy red-fruit and spice aromas are followed by rich, plump, beautifully balanced fruit flavors followed by an extended finish. It only ramps up over time. It's a prototype of the variety and about as good as it gets from the state.",92,30,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Zinfandel
US,"A consistent stunner vintage after vintage, this elevated Cabernet is velvety smooth and exotically laced in coconut, cola and clove. Mouthfilling and succulent, it's high-toned in approach and balance, despite a fierce concentration of black fruit. The highlights are vanilla, clove and dried herb.",93,150,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A controversial wine due to its amazing power. It's just tremendous in apricot, peach, nectarine, marzipan and cr√®me br√ªl√©e flavors, like some dainty from a great pastry chef. But this oversized quality makes it difficult to enjoy with food. Almost better on its own as a cocktail sipper.",89,44,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
US,"A crisp light yellow in the glass, this is a well-priced wine for warmer days. Light grassy tones mix with faint peach on the nose, while the palate is dissected by strong acidity, offering rounded peach, a touch of green pepper and a cement-like minerality.",88,15,California,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"A crisp, linear Sauvignon Blanc, with tantalizing flavors of tangerine, that's bright, clean and easy to like. On the finish, the tangerine evolves into melon and lime.This wine will sit well on tables set for brunch or a seafood feast.",89,15,California,San Francisco Bay-Livermore Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"A crowd-pleasing Barbera full of muted dark fruit, leathery aromas accented by cherry cola and blue and blackberry flavors that's soft and drinkable and packed with acidity.",87,13,California,Amador County,Barbera
US,"A crowd-pleasing Chardonnay aromatically suggestive of candied fruit and dried apricot, it offers a healthy dose of minerality amidst a well-composed structure. Striking the right balance between fleshy and firm, it'll go well with just about anything.",89,25,California,Livermore Valley,Chardonnay
US,"A curious streak of sarsaparilla marks this wine aromatically, followed by sparse, soft layers of black fruit and hidden black pepper.",85,34,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
US,"A dark, smoky wine generous in both tannins and ripe, concentrated fruit. Small percentages of Petite Sirah and Merlot were blended in, the Petite Sirah perhaps for color and structure; the Merlot to soften things down a touch.",85,20,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A darker expression of Pinot Gris than the winery's new Marguerite Vineyard bottling, this wine, which is made from fruit grown at lower elevation, sees no oak, and it's crafted without malolactic fermentation. Pronounced notes of almond and vanilla are layered over touches of peach and melon.",87,19,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"A dash of S√©millon adds to the playfulness of this wine, which is medium-built and moderate-to-high in acidity. Tangy curls of lemon, lime and grapefruit evolve into a bristling back note of crispness that just begs for oysters.",91,19,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"A dazzling Merlot, rich and complex, offering immediately appealing waves of cherry pie, red currant, cola, mocha, brown sugar, cinnamon and sweet oak. Even though the tannins are thick, they're as soft as velvet. The structural integrity of this wine is pure Napa Valley and makes the wine particularly fine.",92,55,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
US,"A decent but clumsy wine, showing the pitfalls of this variety in California. It's very dry and silky in texture, but hot in alcohol, and there's a burnt taste to the cherry and oak flavors. Not going anywhere.",84,36,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Tempranillo
US,"A decent everyday sipper. Soft and a little dull in texture, it's rich in blackberry, currant, chocolate and pecan pie flavors.",84,20,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A deep color, ripe fruit flavors and a richly tannic texture make this full-bodied wine mouth-filling and satisfying without being heavy. A nice, moderate, spicy oak layer under the blackberries and a hint of pepper add welcome complexity.",88,25,California,Sierra Foothills,Grenache
US,"A deep gold color combines with ripe fruit aromas and assertive, seductive oak flavors like vanilla and nutmeg in this full-bodied, lush-textured, unapologetic California Chardonnay. A layer of the tasty oak flavors stays strong on the finish.",90,26,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
US,"A deep red color and concentrated aromas and flavors of dark berries, dark chocolate and pomegranate are offset nicely by a layered texture laced with fine tannins. This well-structured wine will be great with a juicy steak.",89,14,California,Mendocino,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A deep shade of reddish pink, this rich style of ros√© shows red cherry, cola, crushed slate and chalky, orange pith-like aromas on the nose. Ripe plum and strawberry flavors mark the palate, kissed by star anise and plenty of acidic bite.",87,20,California,Chalone,Grenache
US,"A deep yellow-gold color and rich aromas of fig, marzipan and pear indicate this will be a concentrated, full-bodied wine, which it is. Flavors layer peach, pear and toasted almond. The texture is very creamy and smooth, and the finish lingers a long time. It's a great example in the full-bore mode.",92,30,California,El Dorado,Viognier
US,"A deep, dark color, ripe blackberry aromas and berry and spice flavors add up to a full-bodied, impressive wine from one of the oldest wineries in the Sierra Foothills. Smoky, oaky accents help shape the opulent fruit flavors, and enough firm tannins and lively acidity provide good balance.",91,19,California,El Dorado,Zinfandel
US,"A deep, dark color, unusually ripe and exotic aromas, and intense flavors recalling boysenberry syrup make this a monster Zin. It's not very tannic or astringent, but the body is so rich and the alcohol relatively high that it oozes power and concentration. This will be great after a meal with cheese or chocolate.",92,45,California,Alexander Valley,Zinfandel
US,"A deep, deep color, lots of spicy, smoky oak aromas and rich, almost sweet flavors add up to a bold barbecue sauce of a wine. Those who love lots of spice, loads of smooth tannins and very full body will be happy.",86,37,California,Lodi,Zinfandel
US,"A deep, dense blackberry flavor suggests that this is cellar worthy. Notes of ground coffee, cacao and clean earth abound. The finish is long and compact, with nicely polished tannins.",91,31,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"A deeply impressive Bordeaux blend. It comes from this small, but prestigious, appellation, which is a bridge between Sonoma County and Napa Valley. Marked by dryness and a superb tannic structure, it has deep flavors of blackberries, black currants, violets, herbs and cedar. Needs time. Give it 4‚Äì6 years in the cellar.",94,39,California,Knights Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"A deftly made wine, this exceptional Roussanne blends fruit into a creamy, luscious blend of tropical fruits, apricots, whole cream, nutmeg and more. There is so much fruit that it's easy to overlook the crisp acid underpinning, the nice details of baking spices and the exceptional strength through the lingering finish.",92,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Roussanne
US,"A delicious and interesting white wine, made from a variety more usually used for blending purposes. It's honey-rich but dry, similar in structure to an oaky Chardonnay, with tropical fruit and vanilla flavors that have a pleasant touch of bitterness.",90,30,California,Santa Barbara County,Grenache Blanc
US,"A delicious Cab, polished and supple, with ripe black and red currant, raspberry, violet, cedar and mocha flavors. Feels soft and velvety in the mouth. Drink now.",85,20,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A delicious Merlot, drily tannic and rich in blackberries, cherries and chocolate. Nearly as good as the winery's much more expensive Reserve. Great with grilled steak with saut√©ed mushrooms.",92,36,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
US,"A delicious Sauvignon Blanc, barrel fermented in some new oak. It's elaborate in kiwi, orange, pear and honeydew melon flavors, yet crisp acidity and a firm minerality provide balance. Drinks better at room temperature, like a red wine.",91,30,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"A deliciously complex Chardonnay, nearly as good as the winery's single-vineyard wines, which makes it a great value. Smooth and clean, it shows vanilla cream, pineapple tart, Key lime pie and buttered toast flavors. Vibrant acidity keeps it all uplifted and bright.",92,24,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
US,"A deliciously savory wine, brisk in lip-smacking acidity, with the strong, pure flavors of limes, Meyer lemons and kiwi fruits that mark this cool climate region of San Luis Obispo County. Pretty much as good as Edna Valley Chardonnay gets. Drink now.",90,32,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
US,"A dense thicket of dark chocolate is prominent in this wine, alongside black raspberry and blackberry. Dried herb and pencil shavings also make their way through midpalate, atop a soft, approachable texture and full body.",88,75,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A dense, tannic and concentrated Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend, this conveys boysenberry and anise among the thick walls of structure and intensity that give this wine full-bodied flavor. Let it open and enjoy with hearty fare.",87,55,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"A designation used only when a vintage deserves, this reserve is definitely worthy. Almost a decade after bottling, it offers an intensity of chocolate, cinnamon and clove against soft, mellowed and structured tannin. Dusty sage and a bramble of blackberry complete the picture. It may have another five to seven years of beauty left within, but why wait?",95,260,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A difficult wine to like, as it lacks charm. There's something rustic in the orange marmalade and sugared herb tea flavors that accentuates the tannins and acids, making the finish harsh.",83,40,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
US,"A difficult Zinfandel, harsh and scoury in the mouth, with mint, raspberry jelly and black pepper flavors.",83,12,California,California,Zinfandel
US,A directly appealing wine with little obvious new oak influence to get in the way of the clean pear and pineapple flavors that are stitched together by just a touch of sweetness.,87,11,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
US,"A directly appealing wine with notes of peach, tropical fruit and buttered popcorn. It's lightly spritzy, with a creamy feel to the fruit flavors.",87,24,Washington,Washington,Chardonnay
US,"A direct-pressed wine, this has a pretty copper-pink color. It is intense in cranberry and subtle herbes de Provence, with notions of fresh-cut grass and tart Meyer lemon. Young, it needs time in the glass to reveal its complexity and range of flavor. The finish is dry and succulent on the palate.",87,26,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Franc
US,"A disagreeable wine, with so much oak, all you can taste is sugary butterscotch. Too bad, because there's a decent Chardonnay buried beneath.",82,16,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"A disappointing wine. Tastes frankly unripe, with a vegetal undertow to the blackberries and cherries. The thinness of fruit accentuates the alcohol which, although only 14.6%, comes through as hot. The grapes came from the cool Coombsville area, and the wine is 100% Cabernet.",84,225,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A disappointment after the rich 2005. They should have declassified this vintage. The wine is dry and sharp, with green, sharp acids and modest berry, currant and herb flavors.",85,75,California,Oakville,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"A distinctive aroma like ripe peaches and fennel and full, almost sweet fruit and spice flavors give this medium-bodied wine personality. The texture is soft and luscious rather than lively, and practically coats the mouth from sip to sip.",88,18,California,Mendocino,Chardonnay
US,"A distinctive smoky, peppery aroma and equally interesting savory flavors complement plenty of ripe fruit in this full-bodied, dry and balanced wine. Co-fermented with Petite Sirah and Barbera, it shows plenty of fine-grained tannins, giving good grip to the palate and more than just fruitiness. Best after 2020.",90,35,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
US,"A distinguished Bordeaux blend from a winery that flies a bit under the radar. It's rich and dramatic in intensely concentrated mountain fruit, brimming with blackberry and black currant flavors, liberally oaked and framed in thick, refined tannins. Possesses real elegance and dynamism, but it needs bottle age. Hold until 2014.",92,60,California,Mount Veeder,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"A distinguished Cabernet whose superb tannins, which are firm and ripe and refined, testify to its Napa origins. So does the blackberry and currant fruit, which finishes in a swirl of sweet, smoky cedar wood. Good as it is, it's way too young. Should be best around 2015 and afterward.",92,55,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A distinguished, impressive Cabernet, obviously the result of fine grapegrowing and meticulous berry selection. It's bone dry, rich in tannins and firm, with mineral-infused blackberry and black currant flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Will develop bottle complexity for a good eight years.",93,48,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A dramatic spiciness infuses this full-bodied wine with complexity from the aroma through the flavors and lingering finish. It has a dominant streak of smoky oak, a generous mouthfeel, mild tannins and plenty of blackberry and black plum notes.",90,25,California,Lodi,Zinfandel
US,"A dry, late-harvest wine from 20-year-old vines. Floral with a subtle honey note, more like pollen; lemon and orange candy, sleek and deep.",92,18,Washington,Yakima Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"A dry, light-bodied, easy-drinking Riesling, this has zesty lemon and grapefruit flavors, plus undertones of flower and spiced tangerine. The palate shows depth, and the finish is intense.",89,19,California,Anderson Valley,Riesling
US,"A dry, slightly herbal Chardonnay, with oak-inspired pear, peach and pineapple flavors. Feels elegant and sophisticated. Drink now.",88,40,California,Oak Knoll District,Chardonnay
US,"A dry, slightly washed-out Sauvignon Blanc, with varietally correct flavors of apple and herb. Thins out quickly, but a decent quaffer at this price.",85,7,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sauvignon Blanc
US,"A dull, unformed nose gives way to sweet dried prune notes in this highly ripe, earthy wine.",83,23,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
US,"A dusty, brambly Zinfandel nuanced in blueberries and plums, this is smooth and soft on the palate with an earthy quality throughout. On the finish this medium-bodied wine offers leathery tobacco and smoke.",87,20,California,Mendocino County,Zinfandel
US,"A faint perfume of pear can be caught on the otherwise dull nose. The flavors run toward candied pear, honeydew and peach. There's some spiciness to the finish, but also a watery quality that doesn't do much for the wine. In the end, it doesn't hit the varietal mark squarely.",84,18,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"A faint yeastiness subsides to expose luxurious aromas of violet, white peach and green herb on this single-vineyard Riesling. Lushly textured with flavors of yellow cherry and stone fruit, it has a steely, minerally tone that persists through the long finish.",88,27,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
US,"A fairly dark and dense nose of boysenberry and smashed graphite entertain the nose on this blend of 50% Syrah, 45% Grenache and 5% Mourv√®dre, which is named after San Jose-based winemaker Adam Comartin's daughter. The palate is very iron-driven and minerally, with more boysenberry fruit and some concentrated violets giving nuance.",88,32,California,Santa Ynez Valley,G-S-M
US,"A fairly elegant expression of the variety, this wine is bright in cherry kirsch and pretty aromas of rose petal and lavender, structured to age and enjoy with food. Rector Creek Vineyard is just north of Yountville and planted in rocky alluvial soils. Drink now through 2022.",91,95,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
US,"A fairly new player on the Napa Valley scene, this uses the talents of winemakers Cary Gott and Philippe Melka. The wine opens in luxurious aromas of baked blackberry cobbler and spicy cinnamon-clove. Mouthfillingly generous in fruit and texture, it's soft and approachable, serving as a nice representative of the vintage.",90,60,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A fairly rich take on this grape, which many wineries use from this particular vineyard, this bottling is flush with white peach and white melon aromas, cut by lime and dried lemon blossoms, and layered with intriguing kiwi and exotic citrus notes. The palate is more simple, with apple and lemon flavors and chalky texture.",88,22,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Chenin Blanc
US,"A fairly standard Chardonnay, rich in oak, lees and ripe citrus and tropical fruit flavors, but raised up by brisk acidity and a fine minerality that gives it extra complexity. It's rich with honey and brown sugar, but doesn't feel cloying.",86,20,California,Sonoma County,Chardonnay
US,"A fairly uncommon grape for the entire Central Coast, this bottling offers squeezed blueberry and dark purple fruit aromas bolstered by black pepper and black rocks. Lighter in body than expected upon the sip, the palate shows cola, bright cranberry juice and a sandalwood spice that makes it very easy to drink.",88,40,California,Paso Robles,Barbera
US,"A fancy, rich Chardonnay that has concentrated, intense Meyer-lemon tart, mineral and honeysuckle flavors, yet it's elegant, with streamlined acidity. Oak adds the perfect touch of buttered toast. This showcases the opulence of Chardonnay, while maintaining balance and dryness.",92,40,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Chardonnay
US,"A fantastic Sauvignon Blanc. Tastes as fresh and vibrant as a young wine can, with exuberant flavors of pineapples, green apples, cloves, vanilla and cinnamon that are wrapped into a rich, creamy texture. Crisp acidity makes the wine brilliantly clean. With the exception of the '04, an off-vintage, this bottling has been wonderfully consistent.",90,25,California,Sonoma County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"A fascinating wine from one of the oldest wineries in the Sierra Foothills, this has deep boysenberry and blackberry aromas. Flavors include allspice, cardamom and black cherries, with a meaty nuance. Medium to full bodied, it's not a monster Zin but distinctive and clearly delicious.",91,18,California,California,Zinfandel
US,"A fascinatingly flavorful wine by South African Ernst Storm, this shows very perfumed apple peels, pungent green pears and telltale grass shavings on the nose, all lifted by white pepper, wet thyme and hints of dried peaches. The incredibly vibrant palate, with lots of energy and acidity yet not in a biting way, offers flavors of rainy cement, limestone, Granny Smith apple skins and more grass.",92,35,California,Santa Maria Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"A fennel note is prominent on the nose of this silky smooth and voluptuous white. Caramel-topped apple pie richness gives it an appealing personality, brightened by a lemon rind note on the finish.",88,20,California,Sonoma County,Chardonnay
US,"A few words that describe this wine are lusty, brawny, rustic, really ripe, jammy, peppery, smooth and spicy. In other words, classic Foothills Zin. But just as important is what it's not. It's not high in alcohol, nor is it sweet. Drink this balanced Zin with barbecued ribs.",88,20,California,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel
US,"A few years of aging may help this full-bodied, very structured and tannic Cabernet smooth out and gain more complexity. Alternatively, pour it now with something rich like a grilled rosemary lamb chop. It feels tight because of the dense, lip-smacking tannins, yet it does pack in considerable ripe plum, smoke and tobacco flavors. Best after 2017.",88,38,California,Red Hills Lake County,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A fine blend of ripe cherry, berry, spice and herb flavors, all framed in toasty oak and spice nuance. Smooth but bright on the palate, with a zippy finish and subtle earth tones at the end.",92,35,California,Malibu-Newton Canyon,Merlot
US,"A fine bottle ‚Äî full, fleshy, immediately throwing out dense aromatics with toast and roasted coffee and bitter chocolate components. A deep vein of black cherry and cassis keeps the core tight and focused, and a small splash of Syrah adds the scent of black pepper.",91,28,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A fine bottle at a great price, this fresh and clean-tasting Sauvignon Blanc offers a bracing mix of tree fruit, with just a touch of sweet herb. It's clearly varietal: no frills, just straightforward and very nicely made.",88,8,Washington,Washington,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"A fine Cabernet for drinking now. It's rich and soft in blackberry, currant, cherry, mocha and oak flavors, with a smooth mouthfeel and a long, spicy finish. Give it a brief decant.",87,35,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A fine Cabernet from Sutter Home's upscale line, it shows its pedigree with rich, complex flavors of blackcurrant and sweet olive. The oaky shadings are perfect, and the finish is pure and tasty. Delicious drinking.",90,45,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A fine Chardonnay for drinking now, this will satisfy for its creamy texture and tart flavors of buttered toast, oranges and pears.",86,29,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
US,"A fine Chardonnay, front-loaded with tropical fruit, Asian pear, and green apple flavors, with rich honey and vanilla from charred oak barrels. With a crunch of acidity, it's Trefethen's best Chardonnay in years.",90,32,California,Oak Knoll District,Chardonnay
US,"A fine Chardonnay, showing cool weather influence in the brisk acidity and ripe flavors, which veer toward tart green apples, peaches and tangerines. The oak has been tastefully applied.",90,55,California,Los Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"A fine companion to the winery's Lumi√®re Chardonnay, this takes the grape in a much different direction. Here old vine grapes fall under the influence of barrel fermentation with wild yeast. Aged in 40% new French oak, and (presumably) put through malolactic fermentation, it's a buttery bonbon of a wine, tasting of brioche and baked apples, with a silky smooth finish.",91,50,Washington,Yakima Valley,Chardonnay
US,"A fine Merlot, showing the softness and elegant drinkability of the variety. It's ripe and forward in cherries, cola and sweet oak. The addition of some Cabernet Sauvignon and Syrah gives it extra tannic depth and body. Drink now.",88,30,California,Knights Valley,Merlot
US,"A fine Sauvignon Blanc, ripe, dry and pure in pineapple, lime green apple and oak flavors. Feels a little sweet and simple in the finish, but a fancy, crisp wine.",87,24,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"A fine value, the 2009 Walla Walla Valley Cabernet is sourced from Spofford Station and Lefore vineyards. Bright and spicy, it spent 28 months in almost-neutral French oak. Cranberry and currant fruit is forward and precise, with the balance to age another 6‚Äì8 years.",88,20,Oregon,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A fine wine from a producer that dependably produces one of California's best Roussannes. Texturally, it has the weight of Chardonnay, with some French oak influence and the creaminess of lees aging. The acidity is pronounced. Flavorwise, this 100% varietal wine is complex in citrus fruits, peaches and flinty minerality. It has all the hallmarks of a wine that will age gracefully. Drink now‚Äì2020.",91,40,California,Santa Maria Valley,Roussanne
US,"A fine wine to drink now, this has the dryness that suggests pairing it with goat cheese. It has rich flavors of gooseberries, limes and vanilla, with a little smokiness from the oak.",88,39,California,Rutherford,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"A fine, classic California Sauvignon Blanc that demonstrates showy ripeness balanced with dryness, crispness and low alcohol. The pineapple, lemon, pear and lemongrass flavors have a honeyed finish.",87,13,California,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"A fine, delicious Chardonnay, less expensive than most of Testarossa's other single-vineyard Chards, but as good. Crisp in acidity, it offers very rich pineapple tart, Key lime pie, golden mango and lemon custard flavors, made even richer by smoky, sweetly caramelized oak.",92,39,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"A fine, elegant Chardonnay for drinking now. It has rich, honeyed layers of buttercream, citrus and tropical fruits and spices, brightened with crisp acidity.",87,18,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay

US,"A fine, soft-tannined Cab made from Lodi Rules grapes missing some body in the midpalate, but otherwise fair for the $12 price.",86,12,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A fine, useful Chardonnay, made in the modern ripe style. Bursts with juicy pineapple, Key lime pie, Meyer lemon, buttered toast and vanilla flavors, accented with crisp coastal acidity.",85,25,California,Monterey County,Chardonnay
US,"A fine, vivid, crystal-clear Pinot Gris, this offers cool cucumber and melon flavors first and foremost. It's a refreshing addition to the white wine lineup at H3.",88,15,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Pinot Gris
US,"A finely crafted, complex Cabernet that shows classic Napa construction. The tannins are very fine and the acidity balancing, while the flavors are rich in black currants, minerals and cedar. Drink now‚Äì2017.",90,60,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A firm and authoritative Bordeaux-style blend, the Squall Line is an equal mix of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, with a splash of Merlot to finish. Cherry, plum and cassis fruit anchors the wine, with threads of graphite and roasted coffee running through a long, subtle, satisfying finish.",91,28,Washington,Red Mountain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"A firm and focused Cabernet Franc, with just 5% Merlot in the blend, this spent 18 months in 50% new American oak. It's a straight-ahead style, with a red berry flavor and polished, proportionate tannins.",87,35,Washington,Lake Chelan,Cabernet Franc
US,"A firm, somewhat muscular wine, blending in 16% Merlot and aged in neutral oak barrels. Leaf and truffle notes abound, with the distinctively acidic underpinning of Sangiovese. Light strawberry-cherry fruit gently fades through a clean finish.",87,22,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sangiovese
US,"A firm, youthful Cabernet, with cassis and blue plum fruit accented by dried herb, graphite and asphalt. As it sat in the glass, a distinct leathery aroma emerged and the fruit quickly faded.",86,38,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A first bottle was obviously off. A second was better, although still lacking the complexity you want at this price. It was a young Cab, dry and tannic, with a core of cassis and cherries. A few years in the cellar should soften it.",87,80,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A first-rate Chardonnay, solidly exhibiting the house style of dry, elegant complexity. It's the most Chablisian of Hobbs' recent vintages, with brilliant acidity and minerality giving the tropical fruit and oak flavors a stony grounding. It would not be surprising if this wine ages well for six years or so.",94,47,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"A first-rate wine, with well-ripened flavors of blackberries, espresso, cola, tea, and bitter chocolate, but made more interesting by fresh acidity not often seen in today's better Merlots. This cool-climate wine also has sturdy tannins that suggest mid-term aging.",88,34,California,Russian River Valley,Merlot
US,"A five-grape Bordeaux-style blend, this has a scent of rose water that drifts above earthier notes and tart berry flavors. Tight and focused, it finishes with a lick of cola and espresso.",88,31,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"A five-grape, Bordeaux-style blend, it's still a big, tough, chewy, tannic wine with a chunky, somewhat blocky mouthfeel. Cherry, cassis and wood flavors dominate, and the tannins are quite astringent. Re-tasted over many hours it remained stubbornly hard and compact. Give this one some further bottle age.",90,50,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"A flamboyant Chard, packed with tropical fruit flavors and with a lavish overlay of smoky oak. Drinks crisp and clean in the mouth, with a creamy texture and a long, spicy finish. Could use a bit more finesse and subtlety, but glamorous and enticing.",90,44,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
US,"A flashy Cabernet, it's the kind that makes red wine lovers sit up and say, ‚ÄúThis is really good.‚Äù That's because the blackberries, cherries and currants, not to mention new French oak, are so lush. On the other hand, the enjoyment is all upfront, and the wine's aging potential is limited.",87,36,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A flat tasting, slightly sweet, generic white wine.",81,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Pinot Gris
US,"A flood of delicious, sweet/sour floral and citrus flavors sweeps across the palate, a lush compound of satsuma orange and highlights of honeysuckle, Meyer lemon and apricot. It's a tart and vivid wine, with lovely concentration and no rough edges.",91,23,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier
US,"A floral tease of jasmine provides a perfumed opening to this wine, which follows in bright acidity and fresh, ripe layers of tangerine and peach. The oak is moderately present and integrated well.",88,20,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"A for effort, B for delivery on this 100% Cabernet. It shows those famous Howell Mountain tannins, and the flavors are concentrated in blackberries and black currants. An elusive minerality gives the mouthfeel a hard, stony resistance, beyond the tannins.

US,"A light hay color, this wine from Andres Ibarra and Caren Rideau offers a delicate butternut squash cream-sauce element on the nose, along with white rocks and pineapple sherbet. There's lots of pep on the balanced palate, with soda, lime pith and sour orange peel, plus a touch of nuts and a vanilla on the finish.",90,28,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Roussanne
US,"A light imprint marks this high-toned wine, expressive in crisp green apple, citrus and stone. Fresh in lemony acidity, it builds up to a medium body in the glass, offering impressive complexity and refreshment.",91,36,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
US,A light touch in the aroma and rather delicate fruit and spice flavors fashion an elegant style for this light- to medium-bodied wine. Its reserve and delicacy are positive attributes for drinking before the meal or with it.,88,16,California,Mendocino County,Chardonnay
US,"A light, almost delicate wine, with pretty pear fruit and a hint of sweetness. The balance is just right, and the wine shows some added flair as it wraps into a finish that seems to gather strength while adding floral and lightly honeyed highlights.",89,18,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"A light, bright and lemony white wine that's textured and deliciously quaffable, this vineyard-designate is only available in tiny amounts and well worth the hunt. Orange blossom and juicy peach figure on the nose and palate without the interference of oak or undue sweetness.",91,26,California,Russian River Valley,Grenache Blanc
US,"A light, bright version of the variety, this soft and herbaceous wine mixes a subtle richness of toasted oak and dark chocolate with black plum and cherry. It retains its acidity well, showing a tightness of structure with enough approachability.",88,24,California,Knights Valley,Merlot

US,"A light, elegant nose of almonds, apple and honeysuckle, followed by fresh flavors of nuts, apple and flowers on the palate. Pretty, balanced and lingering in the finish. A great food wine.",87,23,New York,Finger Lakes,Pinot Gris
US,"A light, lemony and crisp Chardonnay with a long, lemony finish begging for fresh seafood and spice‚Äîthink fish tacos‚ÄîHusch's Vine One has a hint of just-ripe pear layered in, too. Refreshing and aromatic, this is an all-around great value that'll pair well with a wide range of foods.",88,18,California,Anderson Valley,Chardonnay

US,"A light, subtle nose is followed by simple but elegant Chardonnay flavors and a successful play of oak and acid. The mouthfeel is equally appealing, round and supple. The wine could use more complexity but overall, is enjoyable and will be good with a variety of richer poultry and seafood dishes.",83,16,New York,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay
US,"A light-bodied wine that is blended with 8% Carignane and 4% Petite Sirah, the whole aged nearly two years in French and American oak. There's a thread of minty eucalyptus lurking in this wine, which is lean on the palate, with a suggestion of raspberry and blackberry.",86,35,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
US,"A lighter style Zinfandel, it's also lighter in color. Aromas align more with fresh minerality than deep fruit, though there is tobacco, plum jam and some pepper on the nose. Once sipped, cranberry and pomegranate compete for the fruit side, while cedar and pepper form the spice element. It's great for sipping on the porch and shows how Zinfandel can be impressively lean, even with 14.7% alcohol.",91,24,California,San Benito County,Zinfandel
US,A lightly golden Viognier very floral in jasmine and white peach. It's sweet at first but minerally in the finish and subtle for what can be an overbearing variety at times.,88,19,California,Mendocino,Viognier
US,"A lightly textured wine that suggests lemon chiffon, this has plenty of body to make it feel rich on the palate, along with ample acidity to keep it refreshingly crisp. Apple and pear rise to the fore, maintaining the fruitiness from start to finish.",90,30,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
US,"A likable, easy to drink wine, totally dry and brisk in acidity, with low alcohol. It has savory flavors of lemons, limes, oranges and spices.",86,22,California,Carmel Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"A lingering vein of dark char, spice and toast acts as a counterpoint to this wine's ripe, black-fruited character. The palate is rich and densely concentrated, kept taut by a frame of bold tannins. It's pleasant now but should develop smoky, savory complexities through 2023.",89,22,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc
US,"A little aggressive in feline spray notes, but pulls back just in time to let the gooseberry, grapefruit, lemon and lime flavors star. Crisp acidity provides fortunate balance to this sweetly fruit wine.",86,20,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"A little bit of the old world mixed in with the new, this elegant North Fork Cab balances lush black-cherry and plum flavors against savory accents of bramble, barnyard and dried porcini.

US,"A little harsh in mouthfeel, with some minty green notes that give it the flavor of sweet-and-sour cherry and currant sauce. Needs a cheeseburger to tame it.",84,15,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A little heavy, thick and jammy, like melted blackberry jelly mixed with alcohol. Okay with pizza, burgers and such.",83,18,California,Sonoma Valley,Zinfandel
US,"A little high in alcohol, as is the Paso Robles way, but really a very lush and pleasurable Zinfandel. Softly tannic and slightly sweet, it floods the mouth with ripe flavors of raspberries, black cherries, mocha, cinnamon and pepper.",88,21,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
US,"A little on the slender side, but this is respectable for its dry, balanced texture and pleasant blackberry and black currant flavors. It shows real elegance, too, although it's not one for the cellar, so drink up.",87,35,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A little on the soft side, but very dry, with smoky oak and blackberry fruit dominating. Feels good and chewy and rich, with interesting herb and spice notes. Will age for a few years, but not for a long time. Give it a good decant.",88,35,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"A little sharp and edgy, with some bitterness in the finish, but this is mostly an enjoyable Cab. It's dry and rich in tannins, with currant, licorice and smoky oak flavors.",84,18,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A little sharp, but easily the winery's best non-vineyard designated Cab since the '02. Shows a ripeness level that slam dunks cherries, blackberries, cola and oak onto the palate, yet maintains an elegant dryness.",87,18,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"A little sweaty in the nose, this moves ahead with pineapple and grapefruit flavors, finishing with slightly bitter citrus rind flavors. It's more of a food wine than a sipping wine.",85,12,Oregon,Oregon,Pinot Gris
US,"A little sweet and jammy, this Grenache has pie-filling flavors of cherries and raspberries, enriched with brown sugar, cinnamon, anise and cocoa. The richness is balanced with crisp acidity, but the wine is fundamentally simple and charming.",85,25,California,Santa Barbara County,Grenache
US,"A little thin and herbal, but shows enough Chard character to accompany good shellfish or a chicken or veal dish. Modestly oaked, the wine has peach, tangerine, buttercream and smoky flavors.",84,18,California,Sonoma County,Chardonnay
US,"A little too harsh and raw, and there's heat from high alcohol, although there are other things to like about this Zin. It's dry and spicy, with complex wild berry, currant, cola and beef jerky flavors. The alcohol is 15.4%.",86,26,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel

US,"A little too soft for ageability, but a very delicious wine. Not quite in the league of the wonderful 2007, but offers rich, ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries, cola and cedar, with all kinds of earthy, minerally complexities. Give it a firmer mouthfeel and the score would soar.",90,58,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"A lively and fresh nose of blackberries, black cherries, black pepper, turned earth and fresh fennel greet the nose on this wine that's made by Mike Roth for Greg Martellotto. There are flavors of blackberry-filled licorice spice cake on the palate, though the tannins could use a bit of mellowing.",89,28,California,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A lot of good things are going on in this barrel fermented, unapologetically oaky wine with notes of butter, pumpkin spices and almond complemented by a creamy, rich feel. Still, the alcohol gets a bit too far out front and provides a distracting sense of heat throughout.",87,20,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Chardonnay
US,"A lot selection; achingly dry but not just simple lemon juice. There's good concentration and a mix of mineral, rind, light citrus flesh, with excellent length and a finishing hint of honeysuckle.",89,25,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Riesling
US,"A lovely bottle, carefully crafted from vines approaching 40 years of age. A third of the wine was fermented in neutral barrels, softening the mouthfeel a bit, and kept on the lees for almost five months. Apples and pears, melon and grapefruit all seem to have been mixed in with wet stones; the wine makes a fresh and delicate impression with as much mineral and fruit. Stylish and lacy.",89,21,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Riesling
US,"A lovely Cab, polished and refined, and a huge improvement over the winery's 2004 bottling. Shows classic Napa Valley softness and roundness, a wine that seduces the palate.

US,"A lovely Cabernet that shows the soft tannins and earthy herbaceousness of Alexander Valley. On a fruitier note are the cherries and red currants that are accented by sweet, smoky oak.

US,"A lovely Cabernet, dry and dustily tannic, with a complex array of flavors. The black cherries and cola are accompanied by firm mineral and earthy notes that make this strikingly different from your typical fruit-forward Cabernet, but then, the alcohol is a modest 13.7% by volume. All indications are of ageability. Could age at least eight years in the cellar.",92,75,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A lovely counterpoint to Phelps Creek's estate reserve Chardonnay, this comes from just across the river, sourced from a vineyard on the Washington side of this two-state AVA.

Think of it as a Cabernet Sauvignon that's lighter in body and more elegant.",92,45,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Franc
US,"A lovely wine whose most memorable and distinctive attributes are its dryness and high acidity, not to mention relatively low alcohol. These make it extremely food-friendly, and the citrus, wildflower and vanilla flavors will pair nicely with everything from p√¢t√© to a pear, and bitter green salad to pizza.",87,18,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"A lovely wine, made even more attractive by the value price. It has flavors and lemons and limes and a ripe, sweet edge of honey, although it's technically dry. The acidity is clean and refreshing.",87,12,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Sauvignon Blanc

Made from old vineyards in the valley, it shows classic Dry Creek character, with firm tannins framing flavors of wild berries, dried red currants, pepper and sweet sandalwood. The alcohol is very high, if you're sensitive to that.",89,29,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel

US,"A top-of-the-line effort and a departure from the producer's single-vineyard, 100% varietal bottlings, this blends 4% Malbec and 3% Merlot.

US,"A touch of the veggies, particularly asparagus and bell pepper, mix with citrus in this fuller-bodied white.

The tannins are Alexander Valley-soft and refined. Drink now‚Äì2020.",91,55,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"A very fine Cabernet, although it's tough and young and wants time in the cellar. Strikes you immediately as lush and important, with a fine structure framing ripe flavors of blackberries, black cherries, currants, anise, dark chocolate and sandalwood. Yet there's a juvenile character that, good as it is, promises even better things down the road. Give it until 2013, at least.",93,70,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"A very good, richly tannic wine that flatters with strong flavors of blackberries, cherries and oak. It may be a little too ripe for its own good, though, as it's pretty jammy.

US,"A very rich Chardonnay, notable for its complex flavors of pineapples, sweet Meyer lemons, Key lime pie, buttered toast and smoky caramelized oak.

US,"A wine to cellar. With powerful tannins and near perfect balance, it's extraordinarily ripe and rich in blackberries and currants, with hints of minerals and spices.

US,"Aged for more than two years in new oak, this 100% Cab bursts with smoky vanilla and char that currently dominate its underlying fruit. But it's likely that time in the bottle will meld everything together.

US,"Aged seven years in French oak, this is made from Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes and then fortified with six-year-old, barrel-aged Cabernet Franc brandy. Very little is made. The experience is stellar, the dark-brown-red-hued wine opulent in red candy apple, chocolate and raspberries with ample acidity and a nuttiness to the finish. The pairing suggestion of a cigar is exactly right, though the wine will dance with nuts and cheeses or a decadent cheesecake too.",94,75,California,Napa Valley,Port
US,"Aggressive in grass, hay, gooseberry and grapefruit flavors, this wine's dry, slightly vegetal quality is enriched with sweeter notes of lemon sorbet and vanilla. Notable for the acidity, which makes it exceptionally crisp and clean.",86,20,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc

US,"All estate-grown, this beautifully crafted Cabernet is a fine expression of Columbia Valley fruit. It's lifted with juicy berry and black cherry flavors, then expanded with notes of cola, earth, leaf, herb and roasted coffee.

US,"All five Bordeaux varieties make an appearance in this blend, which offers deep and brooding aromas of black olive, graphite, tobacco, cigar box and elderberry on the nose.

Woodward Canyon wines need time and reward cellaring, but that is not to say that these wines cannot be savored when young. It's just that they will improve dramatically with time.

Meticulous blending of individual lots, some aged in oak, brings layers of complexity and helps differentiate each cuv√©e.

It's dry, to be sure, but also brilliantly fruity.",94,32,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling

It offers appeal but the tannins need time to unwind.",88,45,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"All varietal, this wine is a blend of fruit from top sites Ciel du Cheval, Conner Lee, Obelisco and Stonetree.

US,"Alluringly seductive aromas of black cherry syrup, blueberry pie, blackberry preserves and fresh-cracked black pepper draw the nose into this blend of Lone Oak and Valley View vineyards, located 800 to 1,000 feet in elevation. Flavors of blackberry-chocolate liqueur, plums and black cherries are elevated by pine sap, rosemary and strong tannins that maintain perfect grip. Serve with lamb.",93,36,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Almost 100% varietal, with tiny splashes of Viognier and S√©millon, this is a refreshing wine with medium acidity. It offers a plumpness of lemon and apricot on the palate, finishing dry and clean.",86,14,California,Sonoma County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Almost a dessert wine, it's so rich in sugary flavors of pineapples, apricots, peaches and vanillas. Crisp acidity fortunately provides clean balance, but it's not really a dry table wine.",84,29,California,Paso Robles,Viognier
US,"Almost a repeat of the ‚Äò05, in which the oak dominated everything else. Those waves of caramel and buttered toast taste good, and together with the pineapples and pears, give the wine an exotic taste of some creamy, spicy, honey-rich mashed fruit pudding.",87,25,California,Alexander Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Almost addictive with its fresh, clean flavors of sweet lemon, fig, tart green apple and cinnamon, encased in lively acidity. This zesty white wine has extra layers of complexity and depth. It's also one of the most versatile food wines around.",87,18,California,Russian River Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"Almost all varietal with just a dash of Cabernet Sauvignon (5%) to fill it out, this is an intriguing wine with notes of cherry cordial, chocolate and herbs. With very little new oak influence, the soft, supple fruit flavors are allowed to shine through, giving this wine a real sense of polish.",87,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"Almost always distinctive, and this year has unusual flair and finesse. Shows a Chablisian style of mineral, warm stone, and citrus, but with far richer streaks, like gold embedded in flint. Oak and lees are elegantly applied. More foodworthy than most California Chards.",90,20,California,Monterey County,Chardonnay
US,"Almost as good as some of the winery's best single-vineyard bottlings, this wine has a tremendous nose that offers tangerine blossom, pink grapefruit skin, sea salt and toast around a line of graphite.

US,"Almost black in color and still very tannic, even at more than four years of age, this Cabernet is dry and soft in blackberry, cassis, dark chocolate and oak flavors. Despite being made from 100% Cabernet, its aging possibilities seem limited.",86,80,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Almost decadently rich, this seduces with aromas of toasted hazelnuts, buttery stone fruits and sweet sliced pineapple. In perfect balance and drinking beautifully, it should remain at its peak through the mid-2020s.",94,56,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Chardonnay
US,"Almost entirely Merlot, with a few drops of other Bordeaux varieties, this Howell Mountain red screams for time in the cellar. The tannins bite and dog the mouth through the long, astringent finish. But chew on it for a while and you hit a deep core of blackberries and currants, and the more the wine warms up in the glass, the more impressive it gets. Cellar until 2010, and it should reward for years after.",95,75,California,Howell Mountain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Almost equal parts Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon (with slightly more Merlot), this is a reduced and approachable wine. It's slightly syrupy-thick on the palate, juicy in clove, plum and blueberry. A trace of minerality fights for attention around a medium body, finishing fairly quick.",88,66,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Almost like an Aussie Shiraz, this is a big, bold, jammy wine, full-bodied in ripe blackberries, cherries, mulberries, milk chocolate and spicy pepper flavors. It's technically dry, but so filled with fruity essence, it has a honeyed finish.",85,18,California,Alexander Valley,Zinfandel
US,"Almost no one makes a dry chenin anymore. This is off-dry, fruity and simple, showing nothing of the complexity this grape can achieve if treated right. Citrusy fruit, slightly sugary finish.",85,7,Washington,Washington,Chenin Blanc
US,"Almost one hundred percent varietal with just a small amount of Malbec (3%) added, it's lightly aromatic with notes of berry, ash and green herbs. The palate is tart with chalky tannins. This wine may improve if the acids come in check over time.",87,35,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Almost overripe, with oak-inspired currant and plum flavors that veer into raisins. But the wine is bone-dry and soft, with mellowing notes of chocolate. Finishes in a swirl of peppery spice.",87,26,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
US,"Almost too green and minty, but stops just short of unripeness to give a tantalizing gooseberry edge to the lemon, lime and grapefruit flavors. Dry and elegantly structured, it's a fine wine to drink with ethnic fare ranging from Mexican to Vietnamese and Middle Eastern.",86,13,California,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Almost tropical in style, with abundantly ripe mango and pineapple on the nose and palate, this semidry Riesling is irresistibly lush and fruity. Zippy tangerine acidity and a zesty orange peel note provides refreshing restraint on the finish.",87,18,New York,Seneca Lake,Riesling
US,"Almost two years of barrel aging have impacted this wine, which also appears to have spent a fair amount of time in bottle. The fruit is subdued and the texture chewy in leathery tannins that feel dry and unresolved on the finish.",84,60,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Along with a fascinating nose, this bottling from the appellation's westernmost vineyard offers the rounded ripeness of cherimoya, nectarine and white peach but with a laser-sharp line of crushed sea shell and flint minerality alongside scratched lemon skin. The palate rides that chalky line the whole way, offering hints of lime pith, tangerine, sea salt and just enough almond warmth.",95,34,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Along with a gorgeous blend of ripe fruits‚Äîapple, pear, and a bit of tangy pineapple‚Äîthis wine carries a streak of wet stone into a full-bodied, lingering finish.",92,17,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Gris

US,"Already showing good focus and pinpoint acidity, th is wine brings green berries, kiwi and lime fruit flavors to the front. The bracing acidity keeps it lively across the palate, and the extra depth of the finish rewards your attention.",90,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"Already showing some signs of age in its slightly browning rim, this Cab boasts scents of eucalyptus, vanilla, cinnamon and red cherries, but it's all overly delicate-almost lacy. There's just not enough there to score higher despite its charms.",83,15,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Already six years old, this wine offers aromas of black licorice, dried cherry, vanilla, clove and abundant wood spices.

US,"Although brambly and green with hints of tomato leaf, this red cherry Cab Franc has a spicy, fruity profile with soft tannins and a bright acidity. Medium-bodied with a cherry cough drop finish.",83,16,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc
US,"Although dry, it seems semisweet, with a honeyed richness to the peach, citrus and vanilla flavors. As Rieslings go, it's soft, compared to German versions, but easy to drink for a weekend brunch.",87,20,California,Napa Valley,Riesling
US,"Although it's 100% varietal and comes from one of the state's oldest Cabernet vineyards, this wine is somewhat blue-fruited for the variety, with notes of plum and mountain blueberry along with herb, graphite, espresso and spice. The palate shows more of the same, bringing a sense of restraint and polish along with lightly grainy tannins that need some time to stretch their legs. It doesn't scream Cabernet but it still brings plenty of appeal. Best after 2022.",90,75,Washington,Red Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"Although it's totally dry, this Merlot is a little too sharp, with a bite of acidity marring otherwise pleasant flavors of cherries, chocolate, mint and herbs. At its best now.",85,30,California,Lake County,Merlot
US,"Although new oak accounts for only 10% of the barrels used, the oak influence dominates. Flavors of buttered toast, butterscotch and vanilla ride over the note of pineapple-orange jam. The best thing about the wine is its brisk, clean acidity.",84,23,California,Monterey County,Chardonnay
US,"Although not indicated on the label, this wine is sourced from a vineyard in the Santa Maria Valley. It's a very good, but predictable, Chardonnay, spotlighting honeyed tropical fruit, lime and peach, along with oak-fueled notes of vanilla and buttered toast.",88,38,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
US,"Although one of the cheaper Zins in the winery's line-up, it is showing the best right now, so drink up. Black cherry, licorice, smoked beef and a deep hibiscus note make for a very heady nose. There is a dense yet soft character to the well-structured palate, where strong flavors of blueberry, crushed slate, tobacco, leather and wild herbs make a tasty convergence.",91,19,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
US,"Although priced considerably less than Testarossa's single-vineyard bottlings, this Chard is nearly as good. It's rich with tropical fruits, vanilla custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, all brightened by crisp acidity.",90,23,California,Monterey County,Chardonnay
US,"Although the 2010 vintage was cooler than the previous two years, this Chardonnay still offers rich and luscious notes of cr√®me caramel and baked pear. The intoxicating bouquet picks up layers of lemon zest and mineral.",92,34,California,Livermore Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Although the aromas are sweet, oozing with pear nectar, stone fruit, dried spices and apple blossoms, this wine features only 1.5% residual sugar. It's fairly big for a Finger Lakes Riesling, with a slightly oily texture, and comes across as being close to dry thanks to firm acids on the finish. The only problem with this wine is its limited availability.",90,13,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
US,"Although the blend includes 20% Primitivo and 5% Petite Sirah, which might be expected to add some tannic muscle to the wine, this is a simple red quaffer, with light raspberry fruit and a hint of milk chocolate.",84,24,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Zinfandel
US,"Although the challenging vintage resulted in just a half-ton per acre of Chardonnay in this dry appellation (a third of its normal yield), this wine is fantastic. Flinty and smoky aromas lead to Gala apple, white peach and lemon peel on the nose, while the palate combines salt, grapefruit pith and seared apple flavors. A sharp line of acidity brings it all into balance.",91,42,California,Mt. Harlan,Chardonnay

US,"Although the fine mountain site straddles both Napa and Sonoma, this wine's fruit is all Sonoma, the bulk of it Cabernet Franc, with 17% Cabernet Sauvignon. Dried cranberry shows on the nose and palate, followed by chalky tannins and a refined use of oak, finishing in a bite of currant and cherry. Enjoy through 2017.",91,65,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Franc
US,"Although the label doesn't say so, the wine comes from the Gap's Crown vineyard. What differentiates it from the vineyard-designated bottling, to be released in 2015, is that the oak is minimal, allowing the fruit to shine. With mouthwatering acidity, it brims with pineapple, butterscotch, vanilla and roasted almond flavors that finish delicious and long.",90,40,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
US,"Although there's no oak on this wine, it has a spicy smokiness that could come from a drop of Grenache. There are also percentages of Chardonnay and Pinot Gris that fatten Sauvignon's minerals and limes. Acidity is mouthwateringly high. This isn't a great wine, but it is a unique one, especially for Santa Rita Hills.",87,18,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Although this wine could be held on to for many years, there's a soft approachability that makes it drinkable now. It's a big wine, packed with blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate. If you open it soon, decant it for a few hours.",93,75,California,Spring Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Although this wine is dry, it's satisfyingly rich with honeysuckle, apricot, orange, mango and peach flavors.

US,"Always an interesting wine, Talbott's '03 Diamond T is so distinctive, it's almost eccentric. The candied apricots and cinnamon flavors have a baked pie-filling taste.

US,"Always an interesting, exotically offbeat wine, Ballentine's '07 is particularly crisp and savory.

Very nice as an alternative to Viognier or Sauvignon Blanc.",87,15,California,Napa Valley,Chenin Blanc
US,"Always impressive in its grasp of power and grace, this white is memorable from start to finish, beginning with a dark golden-hay color that dazzles in the glass.

US,"Always powerful in new oak notes and extravagantly rich in fruit and winemakers bells and whistles, this 2006 is very typical of the property.

Drink now.",92,40,California,Alexander Valley,Chardonnay

US,"An impressively dark, powerfully structured and deeply flavored wine, this Malbec brims with explosive blackberry, black currant, crushed peppercorn and leather flavors. With its big-time tannins and dry, balanced mouthfeel, it's a great wine for steak.",88,28,California,El Dorado,Malbec
US,"An individualistic, some would say eccentric wine, made from grapes grown all over the valley. Your first impression is of jammy sweetness: blackberries, cherries, raspberries, oak. Then the tannins kick in, bringing needed dryness. Shows the ripeness of Napa Valley Cabernet, but doesn't seem like an ager. Drink now‚Äì2014.",88,70,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,An inexpensive Merlot that's herbal. It also shows cranberry and menthol amid a light toasting of oak.,85,15,California,Central Coast,Merlot
US,"An initial cranberry note is subdued by vanilla and clove aromas. Spice is dominant on the palate, interspersed with anise and leafiness. Full bodied and big on flavor, this would be a good steak accompaniment.",85,36,Virginia,Middleburg,Carmen√®re
US,"An intense portrait of Napa Cabernet, bursting in red cassis, plum and herbes de Provence, this is a balanced, softly layered wine with well-managed tannins. The time in French oak has provided structure as well as power. Toying for more time in bottle, it should be enjoyed through 2022‚Äì2027.",93,80,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"An intensely lemony wine that folds in some pear aromatics. Quite full on the palate and yet very fresh, clean and citrusy; tailor-made for the region's shellfish.",84,15,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Semillon-Chardonnay
US,"An interesting and complex wine, dry and crisp, and unique among California Sauvignon Blancs. Although there's plenty of citrus fruit, it's marked by other things, such as minerals and herbs, and the sweet, olivaceous taste that the variety's Sauvignon nature contributes in a cool vintage.",93,27,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"An interesting and even somewhat eccentric wine. There are notes of green tea and herbs, but enough pure orange fruit to make it rich. Lots of zingy acidity, too.",88,25,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
US,"An interesting and quite good Cabernet Sauvignon for drinking now. It's soft and melted in the mouth, with rich, complex waves of blackberries, cherries, chocolate and anise, dusted with briary herbs and spices.",87,35,California,El Dorado,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"An interesting blend of baked red currant, jalape√±o, Tabasco sauce and leather mark the nose. The medium-bodied palate is initially smoky and spicy, with fresher red currant flavors adding verve.",87,16,Colorado,Grand Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"An interesting vein of tasty herb flavor runs through this full-bodied, plump and fruity wine. The aroma has hints of dill and sage, and these mingle with black cherry and blueberry on the palate. A sleek texture and long finish complete the picture.",90,20,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
US,"An interesting wine that grows more complex as it sits and warms in the glass. The vineyard long has been source to one of Ravenswood's best Zinfandels, and the 2007 was really great. This '08 is a tad less complex, but shows classic Zinfandel character, with wild berry, tobacco and pepper spice notes, as well as a rocky minerality. It should age for a very long time, although the point score is unlikely to change.",92,35,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel
US,"An interesting wine to dissect. It's very tannic, rather hot in alcohol, and super-spicy, with ripe to ultraripe flavors of wild blackberries, raspberries and currants. Feels a bit rustic and uncoordinated now, but could gain smoothness in a year or two. Certainly it's a very good example of Dry Creek Zin.",89,37,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
US,"An interesting wine, grown in Cabernet country, that's as full-bodied as a red wine. The flavors are solidly Viognier, though, with exotic tropical fruits and wild flowers that drink almost off-dry. Plenty of oak and sur lie aging provide textural complexities.  ‚ÄîS.H.",86,19,California,Rutherford,Viognier

The flavors carry the load, with intense notes of apricots, Meyer lemons and guavas, and a wonderful minerality‚Äîlike a lick of cold steel.",91,37,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"An interesting, off-beat Merlot that successfully marches to a different drummer. There's a leathery, meaty quality to the blackberry and cherry fruit flavors that probably comes from the Syrah in the blend. It's also bone dry and fairly rigid in tannins. From an organic-certified vineyard.",92,40,California,Carneros,Merlot
US,"An intoxicating whiff of musky floral perfume persists throughout this bright, full-bodied Sauvignon Blanc. Gooseberry and white grapefruit flavors are tart and crisp, gaining plushness through the addition of Chardonnay in the blend.

US,"An intoxicatingly sensual Grenache, velvety and light in cherry and strawberry fruit, smooth earth, a streak of anise and deep swirls of chocolate and caramel on the finish. The Dalton Vineyard in Calaveras County has been one to watch for in Syrah and Zinfandel; it can now add Grenache.",92,28,California,Calaveras County,Grenache
US,"An intriguing nose of lemon, pineapple, vanilla and banana candies are encased in a waft of warm yeast. Flavors of honeydew, more pineapple and oak spice are folded into a saline and nutty component. The weight is plush and feels silky on the tongue.",87,20,Virginia,Middleburg,Chardonnay
US,"An intriguing waxy character shows strongly on the nose of this bottling, with ripe lime and green-apple aromas as well. The flavors are light and delicate, with a touch of pomelo that grows with patience into more tropical yet still restrained papaya and bubblegum elements.",87,28,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Viognier

US,"An irresistibly drinkable white wine, filled with the juiciest flavors of citrus fruits, fig, melon and peach, and just the tiniest bit sweet. Crisp acidity cleanses the palate and leaves it feeling minty fresh on the long, spicy finish.",88,19,California,Mendocino County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"An layered nose shows pan-fried apples, caramelized pears, just-ripe banana, roasted chicken and slight quinine aromas. The palate starts tropical and fat, with banana and mango flavors, but settles into a smoked, oaky-apple groove, hinged to steely tension.",91,28,California,Paso Robles,Roussanne
US,"An oaky aroma of buttered toast is elevated over ripe cherry and crushed black pepper. The palate shows more nuance, with tart red currant leading to juicy red fruit and granite dust. Slightly sandy tannins provide just enough grip to give this wine appropriate balance and structure.",87,26,Virginia,Virginia,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"An odd Sauvignon Blanc. Tastes tired and old, showing prematurely dried-out leafy apricot and sour lemon flavors. Seems like it would have been better a year ago.",84,25,California,Mount Veeder,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"An ode to the founding fathers, this bottling is quite tight on the nose, with lime skin, lime blossom and Meyer-lemon juice aromas. The palate offers apple skins, crisp apple flesh, lemon-tinged butter, grapefruit zest and a shaving of vanilla.",86,18,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
US,"An off-dry, organically farmed, 100%-varietal wine, this tiny production offering comes from an appellation better known for other varieties, but that shows finesse here. Fruity and balanced, the sweetness comes mostly in aromatic form, with a bouquet of pungent white flowers. Medium bodied, it shows an abundance of lithe fruit, finishing with a powerful kick of minerality.",88,24,California,St. Helena,Riesling
US,"An oily character of tangerine skin, peach flesh and condensed nuts meets with caramel, pinched soda and cut stone-fruit freshness on the nose of this top bottling from the Los Gatos producer.

US,"An opulent nose surges from the bottle in this lush, exuberant wine from the legendary vineyard site. Pronounced flavors of baked apple, caramel, honey and peach combine in memorable, full-bodied ways. Textured and layered, this brooder is drinking great now but should do well with more time in the cellar, through 2023.",93,60,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"An outstanding Cabernet that shows its pedigreed origin in every respect. The aroma is profound with black currants, flavors deep and concentrated, and tannins as smooth and complex as Napa can produce. So beautiful now, it's hard to resist drinking it, but this lovely wine should improve for a decade, slowly developing in the bottle.",95,165,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"An outstanding wine, the best California Cabernet Jean-Charles Boisset has ever produced from any of his properties. It stands out in any tasting of its peers. Made from 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, and aged in 60% new oak, it shows satisfying, complex flavors of blackberries, blueberries, cassis, hazelnut-infused chocolate and spices. Hard to exaggerate its power and grace. Wonderful now and for a good six years, but it's difficult to predict its evolution beyond 2018.",97,150,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"An overpowering aroma of cured meat on the nose recalls walking into an Italian deli, something one associates more readily with Cal-Ital varieties. Super tannic on the palate, the wine is slightly bitter and perhaps underripe.",83,55,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"An overtly fruity aroma and lightly sweet citrus flavors make this medium-bodied wine easy to enjoy. It tastes fresh and clean, and is rich enough to calm down spicy foods like Thai or Mexican.",87,18,California,El Dorado,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"An oxidative style of Chardonnay seems to match the old-vine character in this bottling that is a nutty yellow in color and shows crushed hazelnuts, dried lemon, sourdough and croissant on the nose. Lemon rinds, tangerine and walnut flavors appear on the sip, which is rich and nutty but not unctuous.",92,24,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
US,"An uber aromatic wine with notes of flowers, orange peel, jasmine and canned peaches. At 27.2 g/L residual sugar, it drinks medium sweet but overall, the acid keeps it in check.",86,15,Washington,Yakima Valley,Riesling

US,"An ultrarich Cabernet that shows the pedigree of its vineyard. It's dramatic in blackberry, cherry, plum, cassis, chocolate, anise and baking spice flavors, wrapped into wonderfully soft, gentle tannins. With a long, sweet finish, it should develop over the next 10 years.",94,95,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"An ultrarich Cabernet whose ripe fruit is as elaborate as you can get. Ditto for the soft, plush tannins and the wealth of fine, sweet oak. Despite the wealth of blackberry, currant, dark chocolate and cola flavors, it's not a wine to drink now, because the tannins and acids are so pert. Give it a good six years in the cellar.",94,235,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"An ultrazesty, lemony Chardonnay, this has razor-sharp acidity that should mellow out when paired with the right foods, like seafood in a creamy sauce.",88,25,California,Anderson Valley,Chardonnay
US,"An unbalanced wine, with harsh tannins and some overripe, pruny flavors. Oddly enough, there also are underripe, green notes.",82,32,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,An uncomplicated combination of red and black berry bramble with an overlay of coconut shavings provides a ripeness of fruit atop sweetened tannins and dull oak in this wine. It's made to be medium bodied and enjoyable now.,84,100,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"An underpinning of soft, grippy tannin carries lingering red currant and cranberry flavors in this full-bodied, unabashedly ripe reserve-level wine. Cola and leathery earth notes combine to boost and contrast the fruit, which persists long into the finish.",94,175,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"An uneasy mix of steel and butter, this may just need a bit more time to settle. At the moment, the twin elements of metal and popcorn clash and compete. For those who love the buttery style, this should prove pleasing.",86,12,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay

US,"An unusual blend dominated by Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with only ten percent Cabernet Sauvignon. Very dark, rich and fruity, with cassis, blackcurrant, anise and herb flavors that are wrapped in big, sturdy tannins. Too young to drink now, unless it's with an enormous dish like braised short ribs, but best left for four or five years.",91,50,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"An unusual commingling of 50% Petit Verdot with 50% Merlot, this wine is expectedly big and soft. Aromas of coconut and baked bread waft to the fore before dry layers of cranberry and blackberry pack their own punch. This wine screams out for a juicy steak.",88,50,California,Calistoga,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"And now for something completely different, this wine explodes in whole-cluster, carbonic freshness and surprise. It's a light cerebral take on the variety that delights at every turn. Stainless-steel fermented and aged, it's loaded in raspberry and cherry-jam flavors and dipped in black licorice. It's fresh, fruity and entirely memorable.",94,41,California,Sonoma County,Tempranillo
US,"Anderson Valley has always been a hospitable home to Pinot Gris and this 100% tank-fermented, no-malolactic-fermentation beauty is fragrant in orange blossom and honeysuckle, a tangible streak of wet stone zipping throughout.

US,"Annette Hoff Danzer is only the second female winemaker in Monterey County, and her wine from Chualar Canyon on the east side of the Salinas Valley offers aromas of fragrant white flowers, lemon-lime soda and lychee. The racy acidity is a bit strong on the palate, but will unwind nicely in months to come, with flavors of ripe lemon and crushed rocks.",88,24,California,Monterey County,Chardonnay
US,"Another attempt at a low-impact Chardonnay unfettered by oak, this result is curiously confectionary and sweet. Apple flavors veer into candy territory and the wine is slightly fat instead of crisp, despite the low alcohol and stainless-steel fermentation.",84,14,California,Sonoma County,Chardonnay
US,"Another Best Buy for this delightful everyday Chardonnay. Shows flavors of peaches and cream, buttered toast and pineapples, with a nice, flowery edge.",85,10,California,California,Chardonnay

Cinnamon and clove intermingle with black cherry and currant, finishing in a hint of tobacco.",90,47,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"Another great Hillside Select from selected blocks in Shafer's vineyard. It's a perfect illustration of the ‚Äúiron fist in a velvet glove‚Äù description of Stags Leap Cabernet, with perhaps more emphasis this year on the velvet than the iron.

US,"Another great success from Merryvale. Somehow they manage to make red wines that are ripe, oaky and opulent, yet maintain balance so that you can drink it over the course of a meal without the flavors palling. Dry and tannicly sophisticated, it shows complex waves of blackberries, cassis, cherries and sweet, smoky cedar.",93,65,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Another Livermore Valley producer to watch, Cuda Ridge has fashioned a varietally textbook Cab Franc here, with an intensely woody, herbal nose.

Drink now‚Äì2013.",90,36,California,Carmel Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Another successful Tannat from Cambiata, the fourth vintage in a row to score at least 90 points. The grape variety, from southwest France, produces a dry, tannic, full-bodied wine like this one. It has a stringy feel, with deep flavors of raspberries. Will age for a very long time. Interesting as an alternative to a big Zinfandel or Petite Sirah.",91,28,California,Monterey,Tannat
US,"Another successful vintage for this wine, it maintains a clean, well-defined mouthfeel that barely registers the 1.3% residual sugar. The aromas of pear, melon and citrus rind introduce similar flavors, along with a suggestion of sweet orange candy.",90,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling

US,"Another terrific Scion from Robert Young. Blended this year from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc and Petit Verdot, it's rich in blackberry and cherry fruit, with caramel from oak barrels.

US,"Anyone making Grenache Blanc in California should be encouraged, Terre Rouge's version being a delightfully drinkable mix of apple and peach with a rich, full mouth that finishes crisp.

It's a far cry from what most consumers would think of as Merlot‚Äîthis is a stiff, tannic, muscular wine, with a deep earthiness that speaks of rich loam and ancient rock.

Plus, it's a fine value for a wine of such quality.",93,34,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Chardonnay
US,"As with all Dusted Valley wines, the focus is on varietal purity, and the careful blending (an addition of 10% Merlot) enhances it, by expanding the midpalate and adding complexity.

US,"At 81%, this could be a varietally labeled Merlot, with the rest Cabernet Franc (15%) and Petit Verdot.

It finishes dry and elegant.",87,20,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Sangiovese
US,"At about four years of age, Talbott's '04 tastes overripe. It has the aromas and flavors of a botrytized, late-harvest Chardonnay, brimming with apricot jam and pineapples, except that it's bone dry. With the very high acidity, this makes it unbalanced and not entirely enjoyable. This is a bottling that seems to do better in cooler vintages.",85,65,California,Monterey County,Chardonnay

US,"At first, a rush of front-loaded plum and blackberry fruit hits the palate, then the flavors seem to sag a bit entering the midpalate. A wall of still-to-be-resolved oak leads into a hard, astringent, somewhat woody finish.

Retasted after being open a full day, it showed well, suggesting good aging potential.",88,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"At first, all you sense is a heavy, operatic costume of chocolaty, smoky, coffee-like oak flavors. Underneath these, a ripe and slightly sweet boysenberry soul keeps the drama going. Like a sturdy stage set, the richly laced tannins support the fruit and oak until the curtain falls.",90,25,California,Lodi,Zinfandel
US,"At first, this wine tastes overworked, with very ripe pineapple, lime and mango flavors elaborated with sweet new oak.

Soft tannins make for easy drinking.",89,40,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Cabernet Franc

US,"At the age of four-plus years, this 100% Cabernet is not showing well. It's very tannic and dry, with mouthwatering acidity and a brittle mouthfeel.

US,"Coming on the heels of the extraordinary 2009 vintage, this '10 is a worthy followup. It's bone dry, tannic and enormously complex, offering waves of blackberry, currant, cola, new oak and spice flavors. It's so good now, you may not want to cellar it, but try. It will begin to approach its peak after 2017.",92,85,California,Coombsville,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Compact and chewy, with clearly delineated Bordeaux style and character. Cassis and black cherry fruit; stiff, earthy tannins, good length and fine aging potential.

US,"Compared to the Mazzoni, this baby has less fruity but pepperier, earthier aromas, and herbal ones, too: licorice and chocolate, although there‚Äôs some deeply scented blackberry.

US,"Concentrated and wonderfully aromatic, this ages for 32 months in 75% new French oak, plus another 28 months in bottle prior to its release.

US,"Corley builds its reserve Cab for the long haul. The wine is too tannic to enjoy now, numbing the palate with dry astringency.

US,Don't come looking for your light and fruity Grenache‚Äîthe 15.2% alcohol lets you feel the fire pumping through the veins of this deeply ripe and potent wine. In a blind tasting you might easily think it was a Zin rather than a Washington Grenache.,88,39,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Grenache
US,"Don't let the generic California appellation fool you, this is a distinctive Chardonnay.

Somewhere underneath it all are blackberries and black currants that are sweetly ripe. Your best bet is to cellar it, but its future is uncertain given the initial irregularities.",87,85,California,Mount Veeder,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Even grapier than the Cabernet Sauvignon, this forward, light, candied, confected wine has a hole in the middle. The tannins turn quite astringent, a marked contrast to the sweetness of the fruit.",84,32,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Cabernet Franc
US,"Even though the alcohol is a high 15.3% abv, this Cabernet tastes like it still has some residual sweetness. It's as rich and ripe in blackberries, but awkward, and doesn't seem capable of aging.",85,80,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Even though the alcohol is a high 15.3% abv, this Cabernet tastes like it still has some residual sweetness. It's as rich and ripe in blackberries, but awkward, and doesn't seem capable of aging.",85,80,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Even though there's no new oak on this wine, it tastes oaky. Shows strong buttered toast and butterscotch flavors, with underlying tropical fruits, pears, white flowers and minerals. Very rich and thick, it can be an interesting substitute for a big, buttery Chardonnay.",89,35,California,Santa Barbara County,Viognier
US,"Even though this wine is nicely dry and crisp, it's too vegetal, with a green bean taste.",82,20,California,Carmel Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Even with Merlot and Cabernet Franc in the mix, there's no mistaking this is a Zinfandel. It has pepper and jam flavors, with straightjacketlike tannins and plenty of body.",87,24,California,El Dorado,Zinfandel
US,"Ever since Tamber Bey made the switch from Oakville fruit to their vineyard in Yountville, their Cabernets have dropped in quality. This '09 is dry, tannic and uninteresting, with a harshness that makes it difficult to appreciate the blackberry and cherry fruit.",85,42,California,Yountville,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Every bit as good as the dazzling 2009, this is 100% Touriga Nacional grapes. Sappy and acidic, it has extraordinarily deep and succulent flavors of raspberries, along with lush, chocolatey tannins. It's startlingly good, and though entirely ageworthy, almost impossible to ignore at the moment.",92,16,Washington,Yakima Valley,Touriga Nacional
US,"Everything about this Cab is out-sized. The color is black, the black currant and cassis flavors are mind-blowingly huge, the oak presence is strong, the tannins are thick, and the finish is long and spicy. It's nowhere near ready to drink. Give it at least eight more years to let the parts find each other and integrate.",90,100,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Everything about this wine is big. It's superripe in jammy cherries and raspberries, and super-oaky, with a sweet coating of caramelized candy corn. It's a crowd pleaser for many red wine fans, but simply too sweet and simple for the price.",85,42,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"Everything in this wine is strong and obvious: With its powerful tropical fruit, sweet oak and intense finish, this is what many Americans like in Chardonnay. But as impressive as the winemaker's art is here, the flash is all on the surface. Drink up.",88,44,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Everything tastes interventionist on this Chardonnay. The fruit is extracted in pineapple jam, the oak is strong, the wine went through malolactic fermentation, which gives it buttered toast flavors, and the acidity feels unnatural given the ripeness. Will satisfy fans of the New World style, but the wine, tasty as it is, lacks authenticity and balance.",86,38,California,Alexander Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Examples of this variety are rare in the state. Aromas pop with heaping amounts of fresh flowers and orange peel that are reminiscent of freesia in their intensity. The coffee and blue-fruit flavors are smooth and sultry, showing pleasing depth.",89,50,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Touriga Nacional
US,"Excellent fruit shines forth in this estate-grown Cabernet from the winery's Horse Heaven Hills vineyards. Flavors of mixed berry, black cherry and cassis carry a proper hint of fresh herb. Notations of licorice, earth and dark chocolate add depth and complexity to the elegant finish.",91,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Excellent winemaking by Mike Januik, as with all these Novelty Hill wines, keeps the fruit, acid and tannins all in perfect proportion. The flavors mix blackberry and black cherry; and this young wine is still firm and wound tight.",89,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Except for a slightly rustic edge to the way the wine feels in the mouth, this is a spectacular success. It stands next to much more expensive Merlots proudly. Dry and smooth in tannins, the cherry, red currant and pepper flavors are outstanding.",87,9,California,California,Merlot
US,"Except for a taste of cooked grapes, this is a pretty good Sangiovese. It's dry and crisp in acidity, with a nice earthiness behind the cherries. But you can taste the burnt berries that just got roasted under the hot sun of this vintage.",83,15,California,Cienega Valley,Sangiovese
US,"Except for the sweetness, this is a pretty good wine. It has rich tannins, decent acidity, and ripe flavors of blackberry, cherry and raspberry jam. But that white sugary taste is off-putting in a table wine.",82,14,California,California,Zinfandel
US,"Exceptionally fragrant, it sends up scents of white peaches and hazelnuts. Savory highlights adorn the crisp, detailed fruit flavors of peach, pear and yellow apples.",94,45,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Chardonnay
US,"Exceptionally light, this acid-driven wine is all flowers and green apple, with just the slightest reach out to honeycomb-like texture and weight. It'll do well at the table in its unfussy approach and crispness.",87,30,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Exceptionally rich and sensual, this single-vineyard beauty has finely ground, dusty tannins. The fruit veers toward sour cherry candy, with a jacket of sweet, toasty oak. Drink now‚Äì2016.",90,40,California,Rutherford,Merlot
US,"Excessively ripe fruit verging on baked, burnt blackberries, hard tannins and residual sweetness.",80,19,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Exciting, fresh and full of spicy, toasted undertones, this wine immediately calls for a food pairing of a richer seafood (think oysters, crab) or poultry. The flavors are balanced and buoyed by crispness, but the wine still offers complexity and a lingering finish.",87,20,New York,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay
US,"Exhibiting cooler-climate characteristics, the fruit sourced primarily from the Stag's Leap District, this wine shows dried herb and cedar on the nose, evolving deeper layers of red cherry and cranberry on the midpalate. It takes on weight and structure on the finish.",91,80,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Exotic pineapple, lime and tangerine scents combine with notes of slate and wet stone on this lovely Riesling. It's quite dry, but feels lush on the palate with a sweet grapefruit softness. Finishes long and minerally.",88,16,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
US,"Exotic yellow-spice notes meet with lean lime pith on the light and crisp nose of this old-vine expression from a historic winery. Meyer-lemon rind and juice show brightly on the palate, where grippy chalkiness complements rich lemon-curd flavors.",91,20,California,Chalone,Pinot Blanc

US,"Exotically aromatic with notes of pineapple and quince, this is a dry, yet lavishly fruity wine. Vibrantly acidic, it's balanced by notes of wax and petrol that linger in a rich, minerally slick.",89,14,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
US,"Expensive, yes, but this is a very great Cabernet, and the Sacrashe Vineyard repeatedly proves itself as one of the best in Rutherford, if not Napa Valley itself. The 100% Cabernet, which is a limited production barrel selection of only 420 cases, is so delicious in blackberry jam, chocolate, olive and cedar flavors, it's hard to not drain the bottle now. But it also shows fabulously rich tannins that suggest aging. May not be one for the long haul, but certainly great over the next six years.",96,165,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Expensive, yes, but very fine, especially if you're looking for a Chardonnay that's drier, more elegant and more streamlined than the opulent, buttery modern style. Sleek and crisp in acidity, this features citrus, tropical fruit and mineral flavors, with a balanced addition of smoky oak.",92,65,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
US,"Expensive, yes, but very fine, notable for a lovely structure and ripe, complex flavors that should develop in the cellar. It's dry, smoothly tannic and awesomely rich with blackberries and currants, and a gorgeous application of sweet new oak. Great now, and will easily develop over the next 10 years.",92,85,California,Calistoga,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Expertly integrated aromas of black plum, vanilla cola, light clove, pralines and a touch of caramel cream show on the nose of this bottling by a Sta. Rita Hills producer that sourced from up north. Wild berries, red cherry and black raspberry pop on the palate, where an earthy tension of chipped slate meets with a baked goods richness.",91,42,California,Paso Robles,Grenache
US,"Expertly integrated butter elements mix with peach and lime spritz on the nose. This single-vineyard Chardonnay offers stone fruit flavors, slight sea saltiness and a long vanilla finish for very easy drinking.",90,35,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Chardonnay
US,"Exquisite scents of ripe red strawberries and raspberries accented by fresh herbs and bramble make Hermann J. Wiemer's Reserve another top pick for Finger Lakes Cabernet Franc. There's an intensity to the bright, red plums that flavor the palate, complemented by a pleasant astringency and vibrant acidity that keeps this wine impeccably fresh.",88,25,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc
US,"Extra dark in color, this has equally attention-getting dark chocolate and espresso aromas, rich black currant and blackberry flavors, and a firm, generously tannic texture. Although tempting to drink now, this will improve in complexity and smoothness through 2017.",90,39,California,Livermore Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Extracted, tannic, dark and dense, with briary, jammy fruit and thick tannins. Blackberries and chocolate, set off with lots of acid. It's a sensational, balanced, bold, ageworthy Zin.",91,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Zinfandel
US,"Extraordinarily rich and ripe in tropical fruits, oranges and honey, this Chardonnay's lushness is balanced by citrusy acids and minerality. It's very good, but you find yourself wishing it was drier and more complex for the price.",89,50,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Extravagantly rich in tropical fruit, orange, honey and sweet oak flavors, this is balanced, with crisp acidity and a dry finish. It's a good example of the popular style, at the upper tier.",92,64,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"Extremely buttery in both aroma and flavor, this wine feels smooth and creamy on the palate due to its full body and soft acidity.",86,15,California,Clarksburg,Chardonnay
US,"Extremely dark in color and nearly opaque, this bottling shows dried violet, lilac and lavender scents, along with a charred black currant essence that's rich but not sweet. Prominent acidity and soft but structured tannins present roasted black fruit and baking spice flavors. Drink 2019‚Äì2030.",95,52,California,North Coast,Monastrell
US,"Extremely delicate on the nose, this wine from the historic vineyard shows bruised yellow grapefruit, sliced nectarine and crushed chalk aromas. The evolving palate starts daintily with cut apple and nectarine, then warms into seared peach, buttered popcorn and ripe pear flavors. A chalky, seashell-like structure and pithy texture ensure a long, interesting life. Drink 2018 through 2034.",94,45,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"Extremely fresh on the nose with a touch of honeysuckle and hint of passionfruit, this bottling also offers fruity lime-blossom scents. There is grip and balance to the sip, with lime skins, grass, more passionfruit and rounded honeydew-melon notes that grow riper on the palate.",88,20,California,Paso Robles,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Extremely intriguing on the nose, this shows aromas of Meyer lemon, green banana and tangerines. Generous yellow fruits like melon and Gala apples show on the palate, which is soft with lemon-bar elements at first but then tightens around green apple skins and a peppery, herbal character.",92,29,California,Monterey,Chardonnay
US,"Extremely light and delicate aromas of lemon, Gala apple and pear flesh show on the cleanly delivered nose of this bottling by Steve Dooley. There is also a lot of restraint on the palate, perhaps even a tad too much, with fluttering hints of chalk, sour limes and riper pear. The texture is compelling.",89,42,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Extremely light and floral, this bottling offers apple blossom, tangerine, apple butter and cashew notes on the nose. It's a straightforward Chardonnay on the palate, with butter, citrus and marzipan touches backed by healthy acidity.",89,40,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Extremely light on the nose, there are faint whiffs of yellow pear and lemon on this bottling from the Los Angeles coast. Yellow-apple skins, dried apple flesh and lime peels show on the sip, which is cut by a decent acidity and proves a straightforward take on the grape.",86,100,California,Saddle Rock-Malibu,Viognier
US,"Extremely light on the nose, this bottling from a dry-farmed vineyard (that's four years deep in a drought!) offers delicate lemon peel and riverstone aromas. Light lemon curd and nectarine flavors play into a palate that's more focused on grippy texture, with some rain-on-slate minerality providing backbone.",91,37,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Extremely rich and ripe, with tremendous pineapple, pear, mango and white flower flavors that have been liberally oaked. Shows a touch of bitterness in the finish, which is probably the result of its age. Still, it's a flamboyant, impressive Chardonnay, like a magnificent old tapestry that's fraying a bit around the edges.",93,35,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Extremely rocky and dusty aromas of turned earth and tobacco meet with snapped dark chocolate on the nose of this bottling from a little-known region 30 miles inland from the Monterey Bay. Espresso bean and black plums show on the impressively dark palate that is well structured, finishing on slight hints of roasted pepper and peppercorns.",88,20,California,Paicines,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"Fairly light and innocuous; you really have to make an effort to draw anything from the nose. The palate is sweet and sugary, especially for Pinot Gris, which should be more dry and snappy.

US,"Fairly light in the glass, this bottling shows chalk, slate and wet sand minerality on the nose, alongside Asian pear flesh, kiwi and honeydew fruit notes.

But the tannins are such that time in the cellar is recommended. Now‚Äì2012.",93,48,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Fans of Barbera will find the hard acids and thick tannins they love in this rustic Italian variety.

Great with almost anything starring sausage.",87,18,California,Amador County,Barbera
US,"Fans of CC will find a wine with the balance of previous vintages. It refuses to be a fruit bomb, but offers a wealth of sumptuous blackberry and cherry liqueur flavors that pull back at the last moment under a blanket of youthful tannins.

US,"Far better known as a Pinot Noir producer, Roessler has released this dry Riesling from 25-year-old vines, and it's a terrifically interesting, distinctive California white wine. At 4 years of age, it's bone dry, showing crisp, vibrant Anderson Valley acidity, and is showing the oily, diesel, peach, honeysuckle and hazelnut flavors of a maturing, Alsatian-style Riesling. Should continue to develop bottle complexity for another decade.",90,18,California,Anderson Valley,Riesling
US,"Far from a fruit bomb, this is an elegant Cabernet with modest but complex currant, black cherry, cola and herb flavors. The tannins are considerable, and so is the acidity. Drink now after decanting for several hours, or allow it to develop over the next eight years.",90,38,California,Carneros,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Far Niente has produced a tannic, drily astringent young wine that's nowhere near ready to drink.

US,"Farrell's 2007 lineup of Chardonnays is a triumph, and this Starr Ridge is among their best. It's a big wine, rich in tropical fruit, peach, green apple, mineral and oak flavors that completely satisfy now. Yet there's an acidic urgency that suggests aging for up to six years, by which time the wine should achieve a honeyed creaminess.",94,50,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay

US,"Fat, fleshy and opulent, a Marilyn Monroe type of wine with enough curves to dazzle. Appeals immediately for its rich, saturated blackberry and cherry flavors, wrapped into soft, velvety tannins.

Batches of apple and lemon give it a crisp edge toward the middle before denser cr√®me br√ªl√©e and vanilla take over on the finish.",85,22,California,Sonoma Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Gallo has held this Chard more than 4 years before release; the reason may be an acidic tightness that still dominates the wine. It's deep in mineral-infused apricot and quince fruit. The barrel regimen consisted of 100% new oak. It's a big, absolutely dry, almost rasping wine, and may be one of those rare California Chards capable of aging. See what it does after 2008.",90,50,California,Northern Sonoma,Chardonnay
US,"Garryana is the winery's previous moniker; once this vintage sells through all wines will be labeled Martin Woods. This bottling mixes green, gold and botrytized fruit from a single vineyard, all picked on the same day. The result is intriguing, though a bit disjointed. Bright gold, pungent and waxy in the mouth, it mixes accents of honeycomb with green-apple fruit that almost tastes like straight cider. The finish is quite dry.",89,25,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling
US,"Gary Farrell is one of the few wineries to obtain fruit from this coveted vineyard. As always, the wine is intensely concentrated in tropical fruits, green apples and pears, with such weight that it can easily handle lavish new French oak. The alcohol is refreshingly low and the acidity is brisk and mouthwatering. This gorgeous evocation of Russian River Chardonnay is flashy and delicious now, but the window of opportunity seems to be between 2014‚Äì2017 before the fruit starts to fade away.",94,45,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Gary Farrell's Bordeaux blend is quite good and well-made, but it isn't showing much complexity now. It's a big, tannic wine that impresses with its blast of fruit. Blackberries, cherries, plums, currants, cocoa all swamp the palate, along with smoky oak notes. Maybe it will do interesting things in the cellar.",87,65,California,Sonoma County,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Gassy and bubblegummy, like cheap Beaujolais, with candied raspberries and cherries.",82,6,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"Generous and flavorful, this is one of the best California AVA wines available. It's concentrated and tannic, with medium-full body, a hint of sweetness and layers of dark cherry and plum fruit. Baking spice nuances linger on the finish. Best after 2019.",91,16,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"Gigantic, huge, enormously extracted Zinfandel. So strong, it's practically a food group. Offers tiers of raspberries, cherries, blackberries, black currants, raisins, dark chocolate and spices. The alcohol level is very high, giving it a hot finish. It's a classic example of this old vine, superripe style.",88,42,California,Calistoga,Zinfandel
US,"Gilles Nicault, who oversees the Long Shadows portfolio, makes this pure Cabernet. If this had a Napa Valley label on it, it could sell for three times the price. The structure is full and fleshy, but with the vividly bright fruit that screams Washington State. Juicy acidity underscores the berries, cherries and plums; the generously applied new oak adds texture and layers of caramel, coconut and chocolate. A bottle that belongs with Washington's (and California's) best.",96,80,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Gingerbread and graham cracker provide this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon with a distinct warmth of character. Elegant, light and restrained, it opens with a prominent rose aroma. It then offers cherry and raspberry delicacy around subtle French oak and vanilla on the palate, all lingering long though the finish.",93,105,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"Give this Cabernet high marks for sheer lusciousness. It's ripe in blackberries, black cherries and currants, with a veneer of sweet oak. Not a longterm ager, so drink over the next five years.",90,65,California,Spring Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Give this deliciously polished 100% Cab a year or two in the bottle to let all the parts come together. It's rich and forward in black and red cherries, red currants and licorice, with a generous overlay of sweet, toasty oak.",91,110,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Give this dramatic young wine a little time in the decanter or the glass to gain its stride. Right out of the bottle, it's tough as nails, but a bit of breathing softens it, bringing out a vast core of sweet black currant. Lots of new oak adds to the sweetness in the form of buttered toast. Should age well, if you're in the mood to cellar it, through 2017 or so.",92,80,California,Diamond Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Give this Merlot some time to breathe before serving. Right out of the bottle, it's tough, gritty and tannic. It will never be a mellow wine, but it does have nice black-cherry and licorice flavors.",84,25,California,Paicines,Merlot
US,"Give this wine 3‚Äì5 years in the cellar to let the parts come together. Right now, it's an unconnected m√©lange of sweet cherry pie, mocha, licorice, toasty oak and dusty tannins. By 2016 it should start to find its harmonious sweet spot.",92,55,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
US,"Give this young Cab time in the cellar to come around. Right now, it's fresh and tannic, with primary fruit blackberry and cherry flavors, and the sweet smoky oak hasn't been integrated. Should knit together over the next 4-6 years, at least.",91,78,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Given extended time on lees to add richness and texture, this wine succeeds on every level, showing a brightly exotic nose of floral citrus before allowing nuanced layers of spicy nutmeg, grapefruit, fig and fennel to slow dance on the palate. Rich, it retains enough acidity to remain fresh and lively.",93,54,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Given more than two years in all-French oak, this 100% Cabernet impresses in balancing juicy red currant and cherry fruit against more savory tannin and herb. Structured, it should gain traction and mellow in severity through 2020‚Äì2025.",90,125,California,Diamond Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Given slightly less new oak (60%) than the producer's Les Sommets bottling, this is an equally rewarding wine, blended with 12% Merlot. Red fruit dominates atop a soft grip of leather, pencil lead and cedar.

US,"Goldschmidt has held this single-vineyard Cabernet back for more than five years, an expensive proposition. And it needs even more time. Although it's magnificent, the parts haven't yet come together. It's massive in blackberry and cassis liqueur flavors, and the tannins are pure Alexander Valley‚Äîsoft and herbal‚Äîbut the oak sticks out like a sore thumb. Put it in the cellar until at least 2018, and it could go far beyond that.",94,150,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"Grown in Rutherford, this 100% Cab may strike some as old-fashioned. It's bone dry, firm in acids and tannins, and the grapes evidently were not left on the vines until they were partially shrivelled.

US,"If hedonism is what you like in a Cab, you'll love this lush bottling from Peju. It's softly delicious, offering waves of complex blackberries, blueberries, currants, sandalwood and sweet milk chocolate. Outstanding, and easy to find, with 10,000 cases produced.",93,45,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"If Napa Cabernet is your touchstone you'll find harder tannins and acids than you're used to. It's a bone-dry wine with blackberry, black currant and oak flavors that are grounded with tobacco and sage.",86,42,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"If the staunchly herbal and green-bean scents and flavors often found with this grape are your cup of tea, this will prove enjoyable. It's smooth and not overly tannic, with those intense green-bean aromatics and a taste of tomato.",85,38,Oregon,Southern Oregon,Carmen√®re
US,"If there was any oak on this wine, and the winery doesn't say so, it doesn't show. What stars is pure fruit from the vineyard, the first ever planted to Sauvignon Blanc in Dry Creek Valley. The flavors are massive, of citrus and tropical fruits, melons, tangy minerals and exotic spices. Just gorgeous, it's one of the most complex and satisfying Sauvignon Blancs on the market. Production was a scant 252 cases.",92,25,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"If this delicious bottling is any indication, this region is prime for Malbec. Aromas of grape soda, black slate, turned loam, blueberry and purple flowers make for a nicely even nose, and the palate is rich and full with balanced tannins. The juicy flavors include black cherries, plums, cassis and blueberry extract, to which crushed, dried herbs give necessary nuance.",93,40,California,Santa Clara Valley,Malbec
US,"If this Merlot had greater flavor intensity, it would be spectacular. It's a very nice photocopy of a great Merlot, meaning that the berry and spice fruit is soft in focus but pleasurable. A great value‚Äîdry and classy in its own way.",86,8,California,California,Merlot
US,"If this Sauvignon Blanc were drier, the score would soar. It's brilliantly crisp with acidity and clean, with blood orange, pineapple, gooseberry and lime flavors. It's intensely minerally, but distinctly lush and ripe, which limits its versatility with food.",85,22,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"If you ‚Äútalk dry and taste sweet,‚Äù as they say, you'll like this wine. It's not really dry at all. But it's very rich in tropical fruit, wildflower, honey and spice flavors that are balanced out by good enough acidity.",84,20,California,Sonoma County,Viognier
US,"If you are a fan of Rosenblum Zins, you might want to try this Washington Zin, styled in the same 16.4% alcohol mode. It's got plenty of syrupy berry fruit, and some very chocolaty streaks as well, but the tannins are earthy and still have a bitter finish to them. The winery's regular Zin is far better.",84,38,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Zinfandel
US,"If you drink this wine too cold, you'll miss the nuances behind the pineapple, orange and spice flavors. There's a minerally undertow, and some interesting herbal notes.",87,16,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"If you like a bigger, broader style, with plenty of toast and buttery goodness, this is the one for you. It spent a year in one-quarter new barrels, another eight months in neutral oak. Oily, buttery and loaded with ripe peach, pear and pineapple fruit, it's a wine to drink chilled and early, while it retains all of its innate freshness.",91,35,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
US,"If you like the toasted, smoky character of oak, this full-bodied, rich-tasting Cabernet will please you. That lightly charred, spicy taste of barrels lends a welcome bite to the otherwise nearly sweet fruit flavors. It's a good value, too.",87,16,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"If you like your Rieslings on the sweet side, this pretty wine is for you. It's brisk in Central Coast acidity, with citrus, peach, honeysuckle and spice flavors that finish clean and long.",87,10,California,Monterey,Riesling
US,"If you like your Voigniers flamboyant, this one's for you. It's an explosion of tangerines, golden mangoes, peaches and pears, with buttery, creamy overtones and a finish of honey. Lots of zesty acidity adds a balancing scour to the mouthfeel.",90,28,California,Napa Valley,Viognier
US,"If you prefer your California Chards on the minerally side instead of the flamboyant, superripe style, try this one. With its stony or metallic and citrus-inspired flavors and extreme dryness at low alcohol, it can be described as Chablisian. Hard to believe the oak is 100% new, as it doesn't taste oaky despite the streamlined profile.",91,45,California,Paso Robles,Chardonnay
US,"If your tastes run to fruit-driven, all-stainless, crisp and steely Chardonnays, this is a great choice. Bright pineapple and citrus fruit flavors abound, and the acids, though substantial, are juicy and natural. The balance, freshness and overall value put this among best of class.",90,22,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
US,"If you're curious about California Grenache Blanc, check out this one. It shows beautifully varietal flavors of oranges, pineapples and honey, with vital Santa Ynez acidity. So rich, it's hard to believe it never saw any oak.",88,24,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Grenache Blanc
US,"If you're looking for a flashy, complex Cabernet to drink now and for the next few years, try this one. It's rich and ripe in black currants, plums and toasty oak, with refined tannins and a full body that finishes dry and satisfying.",90,28,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"If you're looking for a rich, delightful, full-bodied red wine to drink now, try this Merlot. It's upfront in red cherry, currant, cola, mocha and spice flavors, wrapped into soft, fine tannins. A blend of fruit from some of Napa Valley's best vineyards.",90,48,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
US,"If you're looking for a truly bone-dry Riesling from the Finger Lakes, look no further than Ravines. It's uncharacteristically austere for the region, with a lean, light body and a mineral laden, wet-stone palate. Lots of freshly squeezed lime juice and a citrus rind finish makes this an elegant, drinkable choice.",89,25,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
US,"If you're looking for classic Napa Cabernet, this utterly delicious bottling is right there. Blended with some Petit Verdot and Merlot, it's a selection of the winery's extensive acreage across the Stags Leap, Rutherford, Carneros and Oakville appellations, showcasing the synergy of blending. The wine is dry, full-bodied, firm in tannins and extraordinarily lush, with blackberry, black currant, chocolate, plum, toasty oak and spice flavors. It's so good now thay you can drink it, but it holds the inherent balance to age for up to 15 years.",94,150,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Imagine a Sauvignon Blanc with the weight of Chardonnay, and that's what you get with this single-vineyard wine. It's amazing, because the wine never saw oak. Still, it has a vanilla richness on top of pineapple, peach, anise and honeysuckle flavors. Maybe the correct comparison is of a white Cabernet Sauvignon, with the complexity that implies. What a great value.",93,17,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Immaculate freshness abounds in this zesty Chardonnay. While supple and quite creamy on the palate, pristine lemon and pear flavors and a vibrant backdrop of lemony acidity invigorate. Elegantly meshed vanilla and spice tones linger on the finish.",89,21,New York,Seneca Lake,Chardonnay

US,"Impenetrable upon entry, this tannic wine is leathery on the palate, offering notes of cedar, pencil shavings and tobacco. Big shouldered and full bodied, it's powerfully dense and concentrated.",85,37,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Franc
US,"Impressive for a $12 Old Vine Zin, this wine is spicy and full of pepper, much more savory than sweet with plenty of texture midpalate and decent length. Definitely full-bodied, it'll stand up to a plethora of rich foods and even age another couple of years.",88,12,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
US,"Impressive from the start for its rich blackberry and dark chocolate flavors, thick tannins and sweet overlay of smoky oak. Could be an ager, but some bitterness in the middle suggests the fruit will fall out before the tannins resolve.",87,65,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Impressive from the start for its rich blackberry and dark chocolate flavors, thick tannins and sweet overlay of smoky oak. Could be an ager, but some bitterness in the middle suggests the fruit will fall out before the tannins resolve.",87,65,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Impressive, but too sweet for comfort, despite great streamlining acidity that keeps the finish clean. Tastes like sugared orange tea and pineapple jam, with the buttered toast and caramel of oak. Earns extra points for minerality and structure.",87,45,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Impressively dark and dense in the glass, this bottling from Edgar Torres from a coastal site offers pungent black currant, leather, wet asphalt and black pepper aromas. The palate's charred black plum flavors are wrapped in serious tannins and bolstered by bright acidity. This will evolve into a stellar wine with patience. Drink 2020‚Äì2034.",93,38,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Tempranillo
US,"Impressively delicate but also generous in aromas, this bottling shows lemon curd, caramelized apple and a touch of baby powder on the nose. There's a sharp line of salty acidity on the palate, with flavors of candied apple and Meyer lemon.",91,35,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Chardonnay
US,"Impressively flashy, an opulent wine that immediately offers a blast of blackberries, cherries, currants, red licorice and cedar. But it's quite astringent in tannins. Age this Cabernet-based Bordeaux blend for 5‚Äì7 years.",92,40,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"In 2011, the fifth vintage of this Riesling, the alcohol is down a bit, as is the price. It remains quintessentially fruity, done in a tangy/tart sweet and sour style. Juicy apple, kiwi, peach and pear flavors fill the mouth in a most satisfying style, perfect for front porch sipping.",88,13,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
US,"In 2016, Tim Malone has cut back on the residual sugar, dropping it down to 12 g/L, meaning the wine is just slightly off dry. The old-vine flavors rock on through, delivering big bursts of honeydew, grapefruit and lime, underscored by minerals. The depth, length and succulent drinkability are sublime.",94,20,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Riesling
US,"In a blind tasting, it's hard to imagine many people would identify this wine as from Washington, due to the coolness of the vintage and the style. It's almost impenetrable when first opened, with brooding notes of graphite, exotic spice, herbs, toast and dark fruit. The acids are mouthwatering, the tannins firm and tightly wound, and they need significant time to uncoil. But when they do, the wine glorious. Give it at least until 2019 in the cellar or a 24+ hour decant. One of the highlights of the vintage.",94,70,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"In a challenging vintage, this shows excellent structure around rather light fruit. Strawberry and cherry come into play, with some well-managed tannic strength from the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon, Cab Franc and a splash of Malbec.",88,25,Washington,Red Mountain,Merlot

US,"In a cool vintage this site brings out more herbal components, here verging on flavors of green bean. But it pulls itself together with pretty berries, toasty oak, and a gentle streak of milk chocolate. The blend is 38% Merlot, 39% Cabernet Sauvignon and 23% Cabernet Franc.",89,55,Washington,Yakima Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"In a word, wow. What a wonderful Cabernet Sauvignon. It has got to be one of the best buys out there, so rich and smooth in berry, cherry, currant and spice flavors. Only 640 cases were produced, but worth a search. Drink now.",90,12,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"In ‚Äò99 Adelsheim bottled two separate clonal selections; this year they have elected to combine the two. This lovely, young wine, with very ripe, tight fruit, is already showing a bit more peach, apricot and tropical scents than the previous vintage. This is a concentrated, complex and powerful style, which harnesses the oak rather than being driven by it. Delicious and exceptionally long.",92,30,Oregon,Yamhill County,Chardonnay
US,"In an effort to further differentiate the Foreshadow Merlot from the Foreshadow Cabernet, winemaker John Bookwalter has kept each out of the other's blend. This is a riveting, complex, supersized wine, with alcohol over 15% and plenty of intriguing barrel flavors. The black cherry-berry fruit is swathed in spice, chocolate, cedar and coffee, complex and well-crafted.",93,42,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"In Coelho's revamped lineup, Renova√ß√£o has double the residual sugar of the entry-level Pinot Gris, clocking in at 10 g/L. Fleshed out with riper fruit, it recalls apple, pear and peach and is interspersed with honeycomb notes, resulting in a round, ripe mouthfeel that is very satisfying.",90,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"In comparison with the 2008 Cabernet, this is the bigger wine, less sleek, more chewy. As it opens in the glass, the aromas display incense scents, and there is assertive, blocky, chewy fruit‚Äì‚Äìespecially black cherry. The tannins are also bigger, blockier, more substantial than the Cabernet. With hours of breathing time, exotic spices (saffron and more) emerge.",96,135,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"In just a few years 14 Hands Riesling production has jumped from around 15,000 to more than 700,000 cases. Clearly the brand is doing something that consumers love.

US,"In keeping with the winery's other red wine releases, the Cedarosa matches tart berry fruits to lush barrel flavors of butter and toast. It's approachable and somewhat monolithic.",86,26,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"In many ways, this is a fascinating sip, but the components are a bit confusing altogether. Aromas of minty berries, tobacco, rustic leather and a very strong camphor scent introduce the nose, and then a lively, quite foamy acidity consumes the palate, where flavors of sweet berries are cut by garden herbs and pepper. It's a little too overpowering.",86,29,California,Cucamonga Valley,Zinfandel
US,"In much the same style as Brandborg's Riesling, this creamy Pinot Gris has a rich, leesy texture, here augmented with streaks of vanilla and toasted almond. The fruit is tangy and refreshing, tasting of ripe lemons and limes, and the balance and full midpalate show a fine winemaker at work.",89,16,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"In need of a heaping plate of smokey, grilled meat, this Zin is generous in terms of ripeness, with 14% Petite Sirah adding color and depth. Stewy plum and a taste of raisin bread come to the fore amidst a background of leather and soft, robust blackberry.",88,45,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
US,"In the explosion of unoaked Chards lately, the Central Coast has proved itself as the go-to region. Domaine Alfred's bottling is just super, a rich, zesty wine whose acidity makes your palate dance to the music of tangerines, limes, kiwis and pineapples.",87,18,California,Central Coast,Chardonnay
US,"In the mouth there's the slightest impression of sweetness, though technically this may be considered dry. In any event it's loaded with pear and apple fruit, lightly spicy and well suited to any number of picnic, pasta, poultry and salad entr√©es.",89,14,Oregon,Oregon,Pinot Gris
US,"In this 100% varietal wine, tire rubber, spice box and flower aromas are followed by seamless dark fruit flavors backed by firm but well integrated tannins. It shows a pleasant balance that sustains through the finish.",88,35,Washington,Red Mountain,Merlot
US,"In this distinctive, delicate, dry Riesling, the signature aromas of pine, petrol and white peach lead to crisp, tangy, green apple and peach skin flavors that tingle the taste buds. It's light bodied, lean in texture and makes the mouth water.",91,28,California,Marin County,Riesling
US,"In this dynamic wine, the nose shows purple acai berries, fennel shavings, tight graphite minerality and a hot cherry-pie warmth. Boysenberries give tart vibrancy to the fun and lively palate, which picks up richness from blackberry extract in the midpalate and dark chocolate elements on the finish.",93,60,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"In this fruit-forward vintage, it's not surprising to find that what shines here are the bright, spicy and tart flavors of strawberries, raspberries and cherries. The Sangiovese was co-fermented with 7% Syrah, and aged in 30% new American oak. As the wine breathes open the flavors of oak and char come up, and the tannins show some extra grip.",89,24,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Sangiovese

US,"In this vintage the Klipsun Vineyard Merlot (75%) is blended with Cabernet Sauvignon from Ciel du Cheval (22%) and Cabernet Franc from the Taptiel Vineyard, all prime property on Washington's Red Mountain. Tight and focused, this exceptionally well-structured Merlot mixes red and black fruits with exotic spices. Muscular and built to age, it's an amazing wine.",94,60,Washington,Washington,Merlot
US,"In this vintage, the winery stays true to its reputation for making balanced, more restrained Cabernet, offering firm, structured tannins and bright cassis and blackberry around a deft sprinkling of dried herb. Built to age through 2025, it is equally enjoyable now, after a decant. Small percentages of Merlot, Petit Verdot and Malbec factor in.",90,53,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"In this well-made white, half of the wine was stainless-steel fermented, the other half barrel-fermented. Honeyed aromas of almond and a viscous, medium-bodied texture build weight toward the finish, while never becoming cloying. Vanilla and apricot round out the profile, buoyed by crisp acidity.",90,33,California,Dry Creek Valley,Viognier
US,"In vintage after vintage, the winery has chosen to make this blush wine heavier than most ros√©s in California. They've done so again in 2013, giving a darkly colored, fruity wine you could almost drink unchilled as a table red. It has a Beaujolais-like cherry jamminess that is frankly delicious.",87,20,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Incorporating 30% of the variety in Musqu√© clone, this wine offers fresh flavors of green apple, grass and pea shoots, as well as a distinct notion of oak.

US,"Initial wafts of cannabis-like herbs quickly emerge into lime pith, limestone, struck match and oyster shells, with white flowers and yeastiness showing as well. There's a vivid tension between tart apple flesh and citrus pith on the palate, with lemon curd and pineapple elements arriving over time. Sit on this until 2017 so the acid can mellow, then drink through 2027.",91,60,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"Initial whiffs of spring ramps and dried herbs turn brighter and fresher with aeration on this light-bodied dry Riesling. Tasted quite young, it's a bit wild still with sharp, slightly jagged acidity juxtaposing bursts of pristine lemon and lime. Its tautness and savory complexities are attractive though, and likely to meld with maturity.",88,19,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
US,"Initially intense in caramel and salty toffee, this wine offers a vibrant strip of acidity that provides backbone and levity to the body and oak. Floral and fruity in yuzu, it presents itself in a big style, but ultimately finishes with balance.",91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Initially this may strike some tasters as an unusual expression, but give it a chance and it may well become a favorite.

It's all supported by a mineral-driven vein.",93,34,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Chardonnay

The finish is deftly accented by a seasoning of black pepper that lingers on the tongue.",94,85,California,Sonoma Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Inky, opaque and tight, this wine offers a bouquet of black fruits and toast. Though the mouthfeel is full and supple, it is presently very closed and yields scant flavor definition beyond the presence of a very good depth of dark fruits and well-charred oak.

US,"Inox is the winery's unoaked Chardonnay, the first of the vintage. This bottling provides a promising glimpse into the quality of the 2012s.

US,Intense yeasty aromas lean a bit nutty with a suggestion of citrus. Aggressively frothy bubbles give way to cashews and bread dough showing hints of lemon. Grapefruit pith and peanut skin bring a slightly bitter note to the finish.,85,17,America,,Chardonnay
US,"Intense, alcoholic, and wonderfully complex, with layers of toast, spice and fruit. The vines range from 50 to 80 years old or more; the wine is robust, balanced and muscular.

US,"Intensely concentrated in black currants, cassis liqueur and oak aromas and flavors, this Cabernet is so strong, it's practically undrinkable now. It's not just the potent tannins and bright acidity, it's the raw, jammy quality of the fruit. All these elements could begin to come together after 2017.",88,75,California,Mount Veeder,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Intensely concentrated red cherry aromas are accented with a delicate leafiness in this rich, robust Cab Franc.

US,"Interesting to see that Washington State vineyards can ripen Sangio in a wide range of microclimates; this is true to the variety with tart acids, sharp flavors of berry, hints of pumpkin pie spice and tobacco, and just enough butterscotch barrel notes to fill in around the rough edges. This is good winemaking, with a tough grape.",89,26,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sangiovese
US,"Interplanted to Carignane, Alicante Bouschet and Grand Noir, this Zin vineyard hails back to 1895, a grande dame in the region, and is farmed by Ulises Valdez.

US,"Intriguing with bites of melon, stone fruit and bristling acidity, this bright, fresh white wine maintains a level of tension and creaminess. It balances the two personalities against each other with aplomb, before losing some of its luster on the finish.",88,24,California,Rutherford,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Invigorating scents of lime zest and crisp apple introduce this nervy, dry Riesling. It's brisk with lime acidity, but builds in weight and texture with hints of petrol and lanolin that linger on the palate.",89,16,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling

US,"Irresistably delicious and reminiscent of cru Burgundy, this laser-focused effort features bright Meyer lemon, tangerine and peach flavors, with plenty of juicy acidity. It grows deeper and richer as it breathes‚Äîand seems to disappear way too quickly once opened.",94,35,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Irresistible from the get-go, this fragrant wine offers up inviting aromas of citrus, stone and exotic tropical fruits. Flavors of ripe peaches, brightened with vivid acidity, keep it in perfect balance. The 1.4% residual sugar is barely noticeable; the finish lingers gracefully and refreshes the palate, inviting the next sip.",92,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
US,"Is this a table or a dessert wine? Either way, the orange and apricot flavors are watery.",81,10,California,California,Moscato

US,"It clocks in at an astonishing 15% alcohol, but does not show it in terms of flavor. The fruit is plenty ripe and a bit thick, but well-supported with acidity. Nonetheless the wine seems heavy and monolithic, having lost some of the vivid freshness of the other Chehalem white wines from this vintage.",86,22,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"It conveys Asian influences, with lemongrass leading the nose alongside chalkiness, lemon curd and soft peach. Those elements power the palate too, with lemongrass, Thai basil and coconut milk framed by yellow grapefruit acidity and Chinese spice. Serve with pho.",91,42,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"It has the light, silky texture of Pinot Noir, with powerful cherry jam and red currant flavors, enhanced with smoky oak. A barbecued steak will be the perfect partner, but so will a hamburger, the rarer the better.",89,37,California,Santa Barbara County,Grenache
US,"It has very crisp acids and those kiwi and lime flavors that mark cool-climate Chards. Oak and lees aging add richer, creamier notes.",86,26,California,Mendocino County,Chardonnay
US,"It is solid and somewhat tannic, with chewy fruit flavors of green banana and white peach, along with details of citrus rind. Nicely balanced, it carries just a hint of barrel toast into the finish, which holds steady through a long, slow fade.",87,23,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
US,"It may be that this wine needs time in the cellar, but right now, it's tough and tannic. There are some fine blackberry, cassis, spicy plum and cedar flavors, and it could blossom after 2008 for a few years.",87,60,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"It seems that there has been a dramatic increase in the production of this wine. Gassy and thin, it shows a veneer of slightly sweet apple and finishes with a dusting of powdered sugar.",85,19,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris

US,"It shows the variety's lusty red stone fruits and berries, with hints of milk chocolate and baking spices. A bit of new oak brings a wood-spice sweetness. You can drink this dry Zin now or stash it away for a couple years.",87,20,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel
US,"It took Vina Robles some years to figure Cabernet out, but they did it. The Huerhuero now is one of Paso's best bottlings, at a fair price. Dry and sufficient in acidity, its blackberry, cassis and dark chocolate flavors are comparable to a fine Napa Cab. Drink over the next few years.",90,22,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"It was probably the vintage, which was less than spectacular, but this wine, while a good, elegantly structured Cabernet, doesn't justify its price. It's bone dry and tannic, with flavorful blackberries, black currants, minerals and oak. A fine wine to drink with upscale fare, but the sharp finish suggests against aging.",87,75,California,Livermore Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"It would be all too easy to write this off as minimally ripe and sharply herbal, as it first appears. But with extensive aeration it blossoms into a wealth of detailed flavors‚Äîbright raspberry, tart citrus and fresh herb, all with impressive length.",90,45,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Grenache
US,"It would seem like other varieties must be in the mix on this perfumed wine with its notes of apricot, grapefruit and flowers. The flavors are lighter in style with a fresh feel.",84,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
US,"It's a grand, full-flavored wine that pulls together ripe, focused pear and honey flavors. Buttery, spicy oak nuances beef up the palate impression and run through the finish. For all its body and oaky spice, it doesn't get heavy.",90,23,California,Lake County,Chardonnay
US,"It's a shame that just 100 cases of this wine were made, as this bright, fresh, exciting Zinfandel belongs with the best of California, not just Washington. The fresh-picked strawberry and raspberry flavors are concentrated and vibrating with juicy acidity. They lead into a sappy, lengthy midpalate, with an underpinning of rock.",92,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Zinfandel
US,"It's a treat to find a well-priced Merlot that has some gutsy tannin and dark fruit to go along with its sweeter flavors and mild texture. This wine has concentrated black cherry, clove and oak spice flavors, with a firm structure and lingering finish.",89,13,California,California,Merlot
US,It's all about oak in this Chardonnnay. Not much going on beyond the obvious attempt at flattery with buttered toast and vanilla flavors. Maybe a little peach and pineapple candy thrown in for good measure.,83,20,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
US,"It's all about ripe, jammy blackberries, cherries and dark chocolate in this soft, tannic Cabernet. The alcohol is noticeable for the heat it gives, and the finish is rich with glycerols. Drink soon.",87,48,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

The wine is very ripe in citrus, fig, green melon, vanilla and peppery spice flavors, with wonderful acidity and a honeyed finish.",87,11,California,Lake County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"It's amazing how this super-concentrated wine smells like chocolate cherries and tastes almost like blackberry syrup, yet it's nice and dry in style.

US,"It's bone dry and tart, with green mint, gooseberry and grapefruit flavors. Seems like a wine they picked early to emulate New Zealand, but it's just not ripe enough.",85,19,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"It's classic Alexander Valley, soft, rich and thick in melted tannins, and elaborate in tiers of briary wild berries, milk chocolate, black pepper and sweet charred oak. Easy to drink with everything from burgers and steaks to tacos and teriaki beef.",90,19,California,Alexander Valley,Zinfandel
US,"It's difficult to find the aromas of apple, pear and jasmine. This drinks off dry with nicely balanced acids.",86,14,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling

US,"It's easy to drink this medium-bodied, pleasant Cabernet and enjoy the light herb and cherry flavors. Not tannic in spite of 10% Tannat grapes blended in, it feels soft and tastes mild on the finish.",84,10,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"It's fair to call this a junior version of Lancaster's more expensive, superb Bordeaux-style wines. Like them, it's rich in black currant and cedar flavors, and quite tannic, a wine that needs a few years to come around. It's also a touch more rustic. Three-quarters Cabernet Sauvignon, one quarter Merlot.",90,48,California,Alexander Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"It's for you, if you like your Cabs soft, sweet in jellied fruit and hot in alcohol. Tastes like a melted cherry pie, with the sugary, smoky crust.",82,32,California,Sonoma Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"It's great to find both lots of fruit and good structure in a Zin, especially at such a reasonable price.

US,"It's hard to fall immediately in love with this Cabernet, despite the fancy Oakville address, as the tannins are so firm. But it's dry and clean, and although the tannins are the star‚Äîbold and astringent‚Äîthere's black fruit there, too, to help it along. Drink now.",85,19,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"It's hard to get very excited about this wine because it's so average and common. It smells weakly of lemons, and the citrus flavors are watery and thin. It's dry and although there's some good acidity, it feels flat in the mouth. That says it all.",83,14,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"It's hard to overstate how deliciously irresistible this wine is, a celebration of the variety that makes a statement of greatness from the first sip to the last. Golden-hued minerality is the star and pillar of support, a worthy dance partner to the twirls of lacy lemon pith, fully expressive tangerine, grapefruit and stone. Lively and complex, it showcases beauty in a glass.",97,70,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"It's hard to ripen Bordeaux red varietals in Monterey, but this was a good vintage and Mirassou has some good vineyards. The fruit is scented with blackberries and plums and even deeper notes of chocolate, espresso, and smoked meat. There's also a generous dose of oak. It drinks fine and dry, and captures that magical quality of finesse and elegance despite its size, which is considerable. A plush, opulent wine.",90,18,California,California,Merlot
US,"It's labeled Viognier, but the blend includes 20% Roussanne and a bit of Marsanne as well. It works terrifically, yielding a wine with a spicy mix of grapefruit, citrus rind, and Asian pear. Wonderful mouthfeel, with cut, focus and length.",91,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier
US,"It's listed on the back label as off dry, and in fact has 11 g/L of residual sugar, but it boasts a certain roundness and fruit persistence. Though labeled Columbia Valley, in fact it's 100% estate (Red Mountain) fruit, and old vine‚Äî30+ years‚Äîto boot. It's well-crafted, with a mix of citrus‚Äîflesh and rind‚Äîplenty of backing acidity and a thoroughly refreshing finish.",91,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chenin Blanc
US,"It's no disrespect to say this is a great family restaurant-style Merlot. Tens of millions of Americans dig into beef at the neighborhood joint, and they want a good red to drink alongside it.

US,"It's not clear what Swanson means by the word ‚Äúinstant,‚Äù although this blend, which contains some Merlot and Petit Verdot, is rich enough in blackberries, cherries and mocha to enjoy now.

Give it a good, long decanting and drink over the next six years.",90,60,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"It's not easy to get 16.5% alcohol from a vintage as cool as 2010 in Washington. The wine has a grain and grass bouquet, wild and brambly fruit, and plenty of Asian spices. Interesting, though not especially typical for the grape variety",87,40,Washington,Washington,Merlot
US,"It's not often that you see Charbono in a Cabernet bottling, but it works. This wine boasts aromas of ripe cassis, red cherry and woody chocolate. The tannins are pronounced and chalky, giving a full mouthfeel, with sharp flavors of tart cherry and a strong acidity.",91,42,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"It's not possible to analyze vineyard practices from afar, but this wine is thin, tart and astringent, suggesting such possibilities as over-cropping, picking too early, or simply the wrong clones. In any event, it's a flavorless wine with no varietal character.",82,28,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"It's pure Cabernet Sauvignon, dense, dark and what might be called brooding. Despite the massive fruit, the darker notes of black olive and earth are not submerged in sweetness. In fact, there are Stag's Leap-like flavors of rock and mineral. Along with the sleek cassis and black cherry, come highlights of bitter chocolate.",91,42,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"It's quite different from the winery's inaugural 2005 Sangiovese, with more sweet cranberry fruit and chewy, peppery tannins. It's got both muscle and spice, with a sweet, cotton candy core that is buttressed with the power of   the lengthy finish that adds layers of fat and cocoa.",87,20,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sangiovese
US,"It's rare that domestic Chardonnay is truly Chablis-like, but this delicately framed wine fits that description perfectly. Nuanced with mineral and spice notes, this has melon and apple flavors that seem to sail on a gentle sea breeze. It doesn't slam you with oak, instead it seduces with you style.",91,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Chardonnay
US,"It's rare to find a varietally labeled Grenache that comes in under 13% alcohol, but here you have it. Blended with 10% Syrah, it has notes of white pepper, smoked meat, savory spices and red fruit. What it lacks in terms of depth it makes up for in purity and elegance.",87,25,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Grenache

US,"Lodi-based Michael David turns to Lodi, Sonoma's Dry Creek Valley and Lake County to craft this white wine, mostly Sauvignon Blanc with a drop of S√©millon too.

US,"Lonesome Spring and Clifton fruit goes into this Grenache, which includes 16% Syrah and 8% Mourv√®dre. Very spicy and pretty aromas invite sipping; the white pepper stands out, along with tart raspberry/cranberry fruit. The wine feels just a little bit chalky in the mouth, but that actually sets it up well for simple smoked or grilled meats.",88,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Grenache
US,"Long Island is not typically known for Cabernet Sauvignon, but in the hands of winemaker Anthony Nappa (who also crafts excellent Cabs at Raphael), the variety shows remarkable promise. Juxtaposing heady notes of bramble and dried herb against a backdrop of luscious black currant and plum, this wild-fermented red is enticingly ‚Äúsavage‚Äù in style. Sharp cranberry notes and mineral tones lend edge to a lingering finish.",92,75,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Long maturation in French oak lends a distinctly nutty, smoky tone to this brambly berried Merlot. While bold in body and a touch warm in alcohol, its ripe black-fruit flavors are sharpened by cranberry acidity and firm, penetrating tannins. A hint of cocoa powder lingers on the finish.",87,27,New York,Finger Lakes,Merlot
US,"Longoria has worked with this finicky Spanish grape variety for years, with mixed results. This 2010 is lower in alcohol than the wine has been in a long time, which gives it a delicate mouthfeel. It's dense in cherries, currants, bacon and licorice, but finishes dry.

US,"Los Gatos-based Testarossa is building a powerful reputation as a single-vineyard specialist, but this more accessibly priced cuv√©e from Monterey County rivals their best efforts.

US,"Lots of depth and complexity in this single-vineyard Cabernet. It's dramatic for the layers of fruit, veering toward red berries, cherries and cocoa, and for the intense tannin structure.

US,"Lots of new French oak barrel fermentation and lees stirring went into the making of this wine, and it shows the yeasty richness and creamy texture of that expensive handling.

US,"Lots of new oak on this young Merlot, and the wood dominates, sending out waves of toast, clove and vanilla-buttered toast aromas.

It's a good wine that should develop bottle complexity through 2012.",91,90,California,Howell Mountain,Merlot
US,"Lots of oak and ripe fruit in this flashy Cabernet. Too much of both, in fact. Explodes in blackberries, cassis, buttered toast and caramel, wrapped into the ripest, sweetest tannins imaginable.

US,"Lots of ripe, pleasurable flavors of blackberries, black currants, dark chocolate, plums and oak in this dry, nicely structured Cabernet.

US,"Lots of tannins and acidity on this dry Grenache, but it's so rich and sweet in cherries, you can drink it now. Somehow manages to be fun and serious at the same time. A real success for this finicky variety in California.",90,35,California,Edna Valley,Grenache
US,"Lots of tannins and zingy acidity in this young 100% Cabernet. That's what the cool climate of Atlas Peak brings.

There's a sweet vanilla taste that must come from the grapes. A beautiful, complex white wine to drink now.",91,32,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Lots to admire in this Cab. It's bone dry and rich in blackberry and cedar flavors, with overtones of mocha, anise and toast, and is very tannic. Clearly made in a leaner style than today's high-alcohol cult style, it trades some richness for elegance and finesse. This is a wine that puts its bet on cellaring. Try after 2013.",93,75,California,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Lots to admire in this dry, full-bodied Merlot. It's forward and charming in sour red cherry candy, blueberry and herb flavors, with a nice edge of smoky oak.

Two-thirds old- vine Celilo vineyard grapes are blended with estate-grown fruit from even older vines that were planted in 1976.

US,"Lush, plush and absolutely delicious, this shows a range of softly approachable flavors, including blackberry, cherry, currant, anise, cocoa, mineral, buttery oak and spice.

US,"Merlot makes up three quarters of this wine with the rest Cabernets Franc (17%) and Sauvignon.

The cranberry and cherry flavors are sweet, with rustic tannins backing them up.",88,24,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"Modeled on a Right Bank, Bordeaux-style blend, this is 75% Merlot. It's supple and fruity, with ripe, balanced tannins.

US,"Moderately soft, loose-knit, and lightly herbal, this pure, single-vineyard Cabernet is a modest but charming effort with warm currant fruit. The aging in French and American oak shows a little too aggressively at the moment, so decant.",88,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"Monolith is a Bordeaux-style blend‚Äîmostly Cabernet Sauvignon‚Äîthat's dark, smooth and smoky. Citrus scents adorn the deep fruit, which resolves in earthy, substantial tannins.

US,"Monte Rosso red wines are always big, but this may be the most intense Cabernet ever to come from that mountain vineyard. It's in keeping with the Sbragia style of extreme ripeness and oak. Almost sweet, but really dry, it erupts in black currant, chocolate and smoky oak flavors, and needs time in the cellar to calm down. Best after 2011.",92,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Monterey's cool-climate flavors of lemons and limes marry richer, more tropical Santa Barbara notes in this creamy smooth Chardonnay. Oak plays a prominent role, lending an edge of vanilla and buttered toast. This is a very good price for the quality.",91,21,California,Santa Barbara-Monterey,Chardonnay
US,"Moon Mountain dropped the price on their basic Cab years ago, and with it, quality dipped. The concentration just isn't here.

It shows the warmth of the vintage but still brings finesse.",90,60,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"More complex than the winery's appellation blend, yet also requiring time to reach full potential, this shows delicate lemon slices, honeysuckle, surf wax, pink grapefruit and a touch of coconut on the nose.

Drink 2018‚Äì2034.",91,28,California,Edna Valley,Riesling
US,"More immediately accessible and affordable than the producer's great estate bottling, this wine invites the nose with petrol, smashed white flower, wet chalk, lemon curd and pink-grapefruit aromas. The acidity is finely pointed on the refreshing and bitter sip, with lime skin, mandarin-orange pith, quinine and pink grapefruit flavors.",89,20,California,Central Coast,Riesling
US,"More like the 2000 than the richer '97 or '99, J. Lohr's 2005 Hilltop Cab is very fruity, but a little too soft. The cherry, currant, chocolate, anise and spicy plum flavors have a melted quality. Drink soon.",87,35,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"More of a Bordeaux-style blend than a straight Cabernet, the remaining 25% includes a mix of Merlot, Malbec and Petit Verdot.

US,"More powerful and potent than the '04, this simply has more juice, more depth, more power and more detail than any previous Sheridan wine. The fruit is exceptional‚Äîdense black cherry and cassis, with a sense of compact layering that promises great aging potential. This was 30 months in oak but does not seem oaky in any way. It already has the balance, the polish and the length to justify long-term cellaring. Tannins are ripe and supple, bringing in hints of dried herb and black olive.",94,75,Washington,Yakima Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"More tannic than in past vintages, Bella's '06 Belle Canyon shows the same briary, brambly flavors, with spicy wild berries and olive tapenade accented with fresh green sage, black pepper and rosemary. Drink this exuberant Zin soon, with spicy grilled meats.",88,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel

US,"More than 75% of this wine comes from Ciel du Cheval vineyard, with the rest from Upchurch. A blend of 67% Cabernet Sauvignon, 23% Merlot and 10% Cabernet Franc, it's reserved at present, with light aromas of woodspice, coffee, assorted dried herbs and mineral.

US,"Mount Eden's estate Chardonnay typically starts out life as a tight, nervous wine. It's marked by acidity and minerals, and you don't want to drink it too cold. The '04 is a lovely young wine, rich and dramatically complex, with layers of pineapples, Meyer lemons, limes, wet stone, creamy yeast and smoky oak, like an important Chablis. Brilliant now, it should develop additional bottle nuances over the next six years.",93,48,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Chardonnay

US,"Much improved, with different vineyard sources than in 2004, this strong, varietal Cabernet mixes cassis, black cherry, light herb and hints of moist earth.

US,"Muscular, mildly sweaty aromatics make this a little tough to get into, but the flavors are really elevated and complex. There's layered citrus, slate, licorice and spice all working together. The texture is nice, with spiciness coming on late. A bit of sweetness properly offsets the spicy, peppery quality to the finish.",88,21,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Mushroom and forest floor notes provide a welcome and rich earthiness on the nose of this wine, which delivers juicy acidity beneath its denser savory tones. Tobacco leaf and black currant and clove add underlying seasoning.",90,35,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"Musky in leather, tobacco and black tea, this wine is juicy in currant and cranberry before finishing a tad flat. From a robust mountain appellation, it's surprisingly resolved in terms of tannin and the oak is relatively restrained.",87,40,California,Diamond Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Muted aromatically at first, pushing to impart rose, sage and violet, this red offers an edginess of tobacco leaf and peppery meat. Structured acidity provides appreciated support and a contrast to medium-sized tannin.",91,65,California,Coombsville,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Muted at first, this wine opens up nicely with time. Sweet, ripe and easy on the finish, its core is full of black pepper and clove. The grapes are sourced from several distinctive vineyards in Mendocino County. Drink it with a steak.",87,24,California,Mendocino County,Zinfandel

US,"Name checking an old stretch of Lodi highway, this Cab has more red cherry fruit than black as well as a noticeable trace of cedar, lacking in structure and acidity perhaps but decent enough‚Äîand very fairly priced‚Äîto pop open with a midweek steak. The grapes used are Lodi Rules certified green sustainable.",86,11,California,Lodi,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Named after a property that Bill Foley's family owns in Texas, this kicks off with citrusy cr√®me br√ªl√©e and tight honey elements on the nose.

Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"Named after Bill Foley's jingle-writing mother , this wine sings, starting with the starry shine in the glass. Aromas of light salmon brittle turn to apple blossoms, and then a sip reveals sea salt, lemon rind and poached apple, with a nutty macadamia paste note throughout.",93,35,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"Named after the blending of Steelhead Run and Ox vineyard blocks, this appealing wine is fresh and varietal with notes of ripe peach and herbs.

It can stand up to a fat stogie or gamy meats like lamb.",90,42,California,Santa Barbara County,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Named for a great David Bowie song, this wine would appeal to Ziggy Stardust himself with its chameleon-like ability to swing between steely and sultry, almost sweet, diving into decadence with ease.

US,"Named for a Loire Valley clone, this New World wine aspires to an Old World sensibility and achieves it in its floral invitation and bright, peppery overtones.

US,"Named for winemaker Virginie Bourgue, this entirely stainless-fermented Sauvignon Blanc has a grassy, spicy edge reminiscent of Loire Valley whites.

US,"Napa Cabernet specialist Krutz has been looking for a place to buy grapes for Chardonnay. Now they have a Russian River bottling, and it's quite a good one. This shows the region's brisk acidity and minerality, as well as a purity of orange, pineapple, apricot and green apple fruit, elaborated with sweet new oak. Drink now, with upscale fare.",92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Napa Cabernets of this explosive power have the challenge of maintaining balance under the assault of all that fruit. This wine, fortunately, succeeds. It does offer an explosion of blackberries, currants, cassis and mocha, but is grounded by a savory olive notes and minerality. Meanwhile, the tannin-acid balance is near perfect. It will be hard to keep your hands off it until 2020, but try.",94,80,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Napa's Duckhorn house heads south for this ripe-style bottling that shows browned butter, vanilla, squeezed tangerine and dried pineapple on the nose. The palate is ripe and powerful, with honeysuckle, poached apple and lime-syrup flavors.",89,55,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Near perfect in the way it tastes almost sweet, then pulls back into dryness. The flavors of pineapples, green apples, pears, peaches and honeysuckle are made even more delicious by the judicious application of new oak and sur lie aging.",93,30,California,Chalk Hill,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Nearing greenish-yellow in the glass, this wine offers lemon curd, a touch of oak and a flash of white peach on the nose. Golden apple and iodine flavors show on the palate, which proves more bitter and sour than ripe.",86,27,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Nearly all varietal with just a splash of Syrah (3%) added, it has notes of sweet spices, cocoa, and cherry backed by dry, chalky tannins. A pleasant easy drinker.",87,15,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Merlot
US,"Nearly opaque in color, the wine offers slight blackberry on the nose with a touch of pie crust. Despite some berry persistence, the flavors lean toward the savory side of Cab, with violet, tobacco and wild game.",85,17,California,Arroyo Seco,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Nebbiolo has proved to be an enormously difficult grape to grow outside of a few small areas in Northern Italy, but Three Fox Vineyards has done an admirable job. There's pleasant strawberry fruit here with an earthy underpinning of fresh tar. In the mouth, Nebbiolo's trademark grippy tannins proved a backdrop for intense, cherry fruit. Give the tannins a few years to mellow out, then serve with London broil.",85,30,Virginia,Virginia,Nebbiolo
US,"Neither oak aging nor malolactic fermentation was used here, hence the name. But far from madness, this wine is sleek, sensual, skillful and seductive. Crisp acidity, lemony minerality, an overriding freshness and excellent depth of flavor all combine to create a wine that seems to be more than the sum of its parts. Shellfish, light seafood, poultry and even pork dishes would be fine matches.",91,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Neutral French oak played a part in this wine's fermentation, giving it weight and substance without distraction. Exotic on the nose, it's fleshy and high toned in guava and lemon zest, with a memorable length of mineral-like stone that gives it texture and complexity.",92,30,California,Calistoga,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Never overwhelming, Zaca Mesa's Roussanne travels the road of balance and elegance, making it particularly food-friendly. The '06 shows crisp acids and restrained flavors of pineapples, apricots, buttercream, cashew nut and minerals. It's a dry, complex wine that calls for creativity on the chef's part.",90,25,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Roussanne

Golden pear and crunchy apple provide an unctuous, delightfully balanced experience that's crisp in underlying acidity and subtle baking spice.",94,32,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"New oak and ripe tropical fruit, peach and nectarine flavors mark this Chardonnay that is composed of fruit coming from a mix of vineyards in a warmer part of the Russian River Valley. Its zesty acidity gives it brightness, while barrel notes bring a creamy, yeasty complexity. Drink now.",91,50,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"New oak dominates this Chardonnay, lending buttered toast, vanilla and caramel aromas and flavors, while the underlying fruit veers toward very ripe, sweet pineapples. Made in the modern style, it will appeal to Chardonnay lovers of flash, but ultimately palls for too much upfront sweetness.",88,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
US,"New oak sticks out on this Chardonnay, with buttered toast and vanilla dominating the tropical fruit, orange and Meyer lemon flavors. It's finely constructed, with deft acidity and a stony minerality. Drink now‚Äì2013.",88,22,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay

US,"Newsome-Harlow's largest bottling, the Calaveras County is a delicious deal at $24, steeped in ebullient cherry and raspberry high tones, juicy yet entirely elegant. A classic California Zin in all the best senses, it offers black pepper, muted chocolate and softly layered structure.",92,24,California,Calaveras County,Zinfandel
US,"Nice and crisp in acidity, with a brisk, clean mouthfeel, this houses citrus and tropical fruit flavors. It seems a little sweet, so don't expect anything too dry.",85,32,California,Rutherford,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Nice and dry, with a crisp cut of acidity that gets those tastebuds whistling. If you like gooseberries, it's for you, although there are far richer tropical fruit flavors in this lovely wine. The vineyard is in St. Helena.",90,24,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Nice and dry, with black currant, orange rind, anise, tobacco, cocoa and spice flavors. But the wine lacks vivacity and zest, and so loses a few points.",85,20,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
US,"Nice and dry, with fine, firm tannins. Quite a good wine, but kind of one-dimensional, with ripe red cherry pur√©e and oak flavors that don't develop beyond that in the mouth. Shows the risks when you depend on 100% Cabernet Franc to make a complete wine.",87,51,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Franc
US,"Nice and dry, with good varietal flavors of blackberries and currants, wrapped into rich tannins. It's a fine Cabernet to drink with ordinary food, and a good value.",86,10,California,North Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Nice and easy to drink, with sweetened orange tea, lime, vanilla, honey and white pepper flavors, brightened with zesty acidity.",87,14,California,Northern Sonoma,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Nice black cherry fruit powers the nose, with just the barest hints of stem and root. Firm fruit is buttressed by tart acids, and the middle opens up sweetly, adding flavors of cocoa and coffee. ‚ÄîP.G.",87,18,Washington,Yakima Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Nice Cabernet flavors in this dry, softly appealing wine. Satisfies with waves of blackberries and black currants, touched with oak. Drink now, and easy to find, with 38,000 cases produced.",86,17,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Nice to see such a nice Merlot from Ch√¢teau Julien, their best ever. It does what Merlot should, being dry and lush, with complex sour cherry, currant, herb, cocoa and spice flavors wrapped into smooth tannins. A lovely wine for drinking now.",90,42,California,Monterey County,Merlot
US,"Nice wine, and just misses a higher score for a trace of herbaceousness, which is due to the vintage. Otherwise there's some sweet blackcurrant fruit wrapped in fine, velvety tannins, and the touch of smoky oak is just right.",90,35,California,Spring Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Nice, softly lush texture on this Cab Franc, with ripe red cherry pie filling, red currant, licorice and cola flavors, accented with smoky oak. It's a little candy-sweet and simple. Drink soon.",87,48,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Franc
US,"Nicely balanced and detailed, this Malbec includes small amounts of Cab Franc and Syrah. Tangy raspberry and spicy strawberry jam fruit flavors are dusted with toast and cracker notes. The wine spent 18 months in half new, half neutral oak barrels.",89,30,Oregon,Columbia Valley (OR),Malbec
US,"Nicely balanced and fairly fruity, this wine is easy to like for its crisp apple and grapefruit aromas, fresh and ripe flavors and smooth and lively texture.",87,10,California,California,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Nicely behaved and well balanced, this gentle wine offers medium body, fresh plum flavors and a texture that's smooth and lightly tannic. The color is relatively deep and aromas are fruity, with a touch of earth.",89,10,California,California,Merlot
US,"Nicely concentrated fruit flavors and an especially rich, almost thick texture help this full-bodied wine stand out from the pack. Black cherries and blackberries spill out of the aroma and into the flavors, where they become quite vivid and lingering.",91,44,California,Mendocino County,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Nicely dry and tart in acidity, this pretty wine is fine to drink now. Flavors recall citrus fruits with richer notes of papayas, along with gooseberries and green mint from cool-climate grapes. Made without the malolactic fermentation, the wine was coopered in 55% French oak.",88,33,California,Chalk Hill,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Nicely integrated, this large production wine is a fantastic deal for the quality, delivering layers of apple and Meyer lemon flavors within a frame of juicy acidity and balanced oak. A tease of nutmeg-dusted apricot lingers on the finish.",90,20,California,Los Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"Nicely layered, this offers an intensity of black plum and chocolate around a soft core of approachable, rounded tannins. Medium bodied, it has a mix of elegance and decadence that makes it drinkable now and impressive from start to finish.",91,37,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Nicely lean and not overly fruity, this medium-bodied wine has the typical firm tannins, leathery aromas and herbal flavors of the grape variety and makes a nice change of pace from the usual California menu of full-bodied, oaky concoctions.",87,21,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Sangiovese
US,"Nicely perfumed on the nose, this Merlot has 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Syrah blended in, giving it a well-rounded composition and bright black cherry around firm, still prominent tannins. It could use some time in the cellar, through 2018, or a decant.",89,28,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
US,"Nicely ripe fruit flavors and a full rounded texture give this affordably priced wine more presence than most. The aroma is honeydew melon and the flavors are ripe apple and Anjou pear, while the acidity is on the soft side.",89,13,California,California,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Nicely structured, with citrus fruits (lemon, lime, pink grapefruit) displayed against stiffer flavors of skin. There is a hint of residual sugar, and the alcohol is just under 13%, but the overall impression is a dry, tight style with little or no floral character.",87,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
US,"Nicely styled, showing lots of licorice in the nose and in the flavors. Blackberry and plum, cedar and spice are gently introduced, and the balance of fruit, acid and tannin is taut and proportionate.",88,33,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"Nicely textured and balanced, this white from a cooler subsection of the larger Napa Valley is more austere than not, a taste of lemon and licorice combining in a medium-bodied package of refreshment. The mouthfeel works consistently from start to finish, the end note smooth and swift.",89,32,California,Oak Knoll District,Chardonnay

US,"No doubt Michael-David is going for a certain style with Earthquake, describing it as ‚Äúover the top and shattering to the veins.‚Äù Indeed. This Lodi Zin will knock your socks and several other pieces of clothing off with its smoky, greasy, hot and sweet berry pie flavors, with a side of bacon to boot. True to its style, this is one very big boy.",85,26,California,Lodi,Zinfandel
US,"No doubt this is mountain grown Zin, still tight but revealing nice aromatics of cherry and spicy licorice on the finish, accompanied by a healthy helping of espresso, wrapped in smooth tannins all around. Should only get better over the next year or two.",88,24,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
US,"No information was given as far as whether this was entirely stainless fermented, but that is the clear impression. Light fruit flavors of apple, pear, and green banana combine in a crisp wine that is modest in scale, balanced and fresh.",87,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
US,"No oak here, thank you; just pure and delicious Riesling fruit with a hint of botrytis to add complexity to the apple-pear range of flavors. This dry-finished wine can hang with powerful chili-based dishes and is delightful as an aperitif.",90,13,Washington,Yakima Valley,Riesling
US,"No one will ever complain that this Napa Valley-Sonoma County blend isn't fruity enough. It's deliciously explosive in jammy blackberries, cassis, cherries and milk chocolate. Oak adds notes of caramel. But flavor isn't everything, and this wine would benefit from greater restraint and structural integrity.",88,70,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"No punches are pulled on this blend of Dionysus, Northridge, Red Heaven and Stone Tree vineyards. Light aromas of coffee, toffee and herbs lead to √ºber rich, sweet, high-octane cherry flavors that are backed by grainy tannins.",91,60,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"No, that vintage is not a typo. This winery holds back its wines for an extended time prior to release. It's in full bloom with aromas of coffee, dried cherry, flowers, leather and black tea. The black fruit flavors are still fresh and lively, showing concentration and detail. Drink now.",91,48,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Nondescript in aroma, this soft Cabernet Franc offers pronounced tannins and a taste of red currant.",84,32,California,Santa Clara Valley,Cabernet Franc
US,"Norm Yost is considered the sparkling pioneer of Santa Barbara County, and his bubblies continue to excel. This exhibits fresh lemon and lime zest notes, with wet cement, peach blossom and sourdough yeast on the nose. There is a grippy tension to the palate, where lemon, green apple and biscuity flavors intermingle.",92,40,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Blanc
US,"Norman Conquest, get it? The wine itself is too soft, and lacks the tannin-acid structure needed for balance. Too bad, because the oak-infused cherry and blackberry flavors are fine.",83,20,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Not a dry table wine, but sweet and dessert-like, although it's not classified as late harvest. Shows apricot, peach, pineapple and honeysuckle flavors set off by crisp acidity.",84,14,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Riesling
US,"Not a good year for this wine, which is green and fuzzy on the tongue, a strange waft of chemical overpowering over all.",80,12,California,Clarksburg,Merlot
US,"Not a lot of aromas in this 14.9% old-vine Zin, though a touch of fruit shows up mid-palate. Pretty so-so.",83,28,California,El Dorado,Zinfandel
US,"Not a showy wine, but this is well balanced, aromatic, flavorful and feels right on the palate. It smells like red cherries and black plums, and tastes fruity with spicy undertones. A touch of tannin and a dash of good acidity give it poise.",90,30,California,Livermore Valley,Cabernet Franc
US,"Not a whole lot going on in this soft, simple wine. The cherry, raspberry and root beer flavors are ultraripe, with a liqueured quality, and the finish is semisweet.",84,39,California,Santa Barbara County,Grenache
US,"Not a wine for drinking now or anytime soon. It's so hard in tannins, it basically locks down the palate, and the astringency seems to accentuate the acidity and dryness. However, there is a deep core of blackberry essence and, after all, this is Montelena. All indications are that it will be a terrific wine in another 8 or 10 years.",92,135,California,Calistoga,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Not afraid to wear high alcohol and toasty oak on its sleeve, it kicks off with a marshmallow, whipped cream and macadamia-nut nose, making it perfect for those who love the California cocktail style but are seeking nuance as well. On the palate, the wine is soft and buttery, with a long buttercream finish. Pair with oven-roasted chicken.",90,26,California,Paso Robles,Chardonnay
US,"Not an easy wine to appreciate now. It's tannic, and the fruit is fresh and primary, with the sweet, candied taste of a chewy raspberry twist. Still, there's something complex and interesting going on. It's not just another overripe Zin. Give it a year or two to come around.",89,40,California,Howell Mountain,Zinfandel
US,"Not as fleshy as many examples of this southern Rh√¥ne blend, this shows thin, generic fruit with no particular focus.",82,21,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Marsanne-Roussanne
US,"Not as rich or chewy as the Diamond Mountain Ranch bottling, Sterling's 2004 Reserve Cabernet is immediately accessible, offering aromas and flavors of cassis and dried spices and soft tannins. A good steak house red.",89,75,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Not as successful as the winery's Cabernet, this Merlot is very dry and tannic, with only modest blackberry fruit flavors, but it has a certain elegance. Turns oaky and herbal on the finish. Probably best soon.",87,30,California,Rutherford,Merlot
US,"Not at all a typical Sauvignon Blanc, this smells like apricot and honeysuckle and tastes like marmalade. It is dry, yet tastes like a late-harvest dessert wine. Expect a little taste adventure here.",85,22,California,Sierra Foothills,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Not bad for a seven buck Chardonnay in a screwtop. Shows plenty of varietal flavor in the buttercream, honey and pineapple flavors. Easy to find, with 20,000 cases produced.",84,7,California,California,Chardonnay
US,"Not for fans of rich Chardonnays, this is a very dry, acidic bottling. It's more about clean mouthfeel and scour than hedonism. What fruit there is suggests limes, pears and brisk minerals, while smoky oak and lees contribute toasty, buttery, creamy notes. A distinguished and elegant wine that defines cool-climate coastal conditions. Grows more complex and interesting as it warms in the glass.",93,38,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
US,"Not from old vines, but cloned from them in the pursuit of complexity. This is a very young, backward Zin, dominated by dusty, earthy notes, like a whiff of south-facing barnboard under a hot summer sun. There are some fruity, spicy flavors, but the flavors are similarly closed, and moderate tannins and high acidity produce a scouring texture. Might be more user-friendly with a few years of aging.",85,15,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel
US,"Not many varietal Marsannes are made in California, and this one is impressive. Savory, earthy nuances‚Äîrather than fruity ones‚Äîdominate, giving it a distinctive flavor profile. It starts with dried herb and mineral aromas, brings in fennel bulb and white pepper flavors and wraps it all with a luscious texture that powers a long, lingering finish.",91,30,California,Guenoc Valley,Marsanne
US,"Not much complexity in this wine. It's oaky, rich in honey, pear and pineapple flavors, and soft, with a butterscotch finish.",84,28,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay

US,"Not offering much now beyond a full body, big tannins, lots of oak and extracted blackberry jam and milk chocolate fruit. There's lots of deliciousness, but not much elegance or sophistication. Roll the dice and stash it for six years to see what happens.",87,65,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Not one of the best Cabs from this venerable winery. Despite a cool vintage, there's a burnt edge to the blackberry pie filling flavors. Tasted in late 2007, the tannins are very astringent, and shut down the palate. Could show better after 2008.",85,38,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Not overly expressive on the nose or palate, this Chardonnay brings muddled citron and salty cheese rind notes into the mix. Light in style, the acids are a bit sharp come the short finish.",82,49,Michigan,Lake Michigan Shore,Chardonnay
US,"Not particularly varietal for a Chenin Blanc, but a pleasantly rich white wine to drink now. It's crisp in acidity, with sweet flavors of oranges, honey and vanilla.",87,18,California,Santa Barbara County,Chenin Blanc
US,"Not quite up there with previous vintages, although they've held the price and that's a good thing. The cold vintage took its toll, making this wine tart and somewhat green and herbal. Shows enough citrus and peach fruit to get by.",86,19,California,Sonoma County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Not showing much pleasure right out of the bottle, with a sharp, tannic mouthfeel. There's a deep core of black currant fruit that veers into overripe raisins. Might age, but it's risky.",85,75,California,Sonoma Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Not showing very well and smelling like sweet soda. Spring for Klinker Brick's 2008 Old Ghost instead, a much more stellar version of Lodi old-vine Zin, double the price but worth every additional dollar.",83,18,California,Lodi,Zinfandel
US,Not showing well now due to hard tannins and extreme dryness. There's a core of blackberry fruit but it's buried beneath astringency. This Merlot-based Bordeaux blend may develop.,85,45,California,Alexander Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Not sure which vineyard sourced the grapes, but this is a flavorful, ready-to-drink bottle of wine. There is substantial evidence of aging in expensive new oak barrels, with a lot of coconut flavor over toast, chocolate and cherry. Tannins are soft and the fruit is round and luscious; except for a slight fall-off in the finish this could be from any one of a number of well-known Walla Walla wineries.",89,28,Oregon,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Merlot
US,"Not sweet or soft, this assertive dry wine has effusive herb and snap-pea aromas and flavors, bright acidity and medium body. It's a refreshing pour for a hot afternoon or evening.",87,12,California,California,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Not terribly complicated, but it offers plenty of everyday pleasure, with its array of cherry, plum, oak and spice flavors.",84,12,California,California,Merlot
US,"Not the best Monte Bello to emerge in recent years. There's a sharpness of acidity that cuts the palate, and it accentuates the fresh fruit, giving it a jammy zing. More troubling is an overripe raisiny flavor. This bottling is, of course, one of the most ageable in California, but the inherent imbalance seems to mitigate against long time in the cellar.",88,145,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"Not very Chardonnay-like, more like a Viognier or Pinot Gris with its aromatic floral, tropical fruit, citrus, melon and spice aromas and flavors. Still, it's very tasty, and dry as well, with a crisp spine of minerally acidity.",87,28,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Not very Oakville-like, this Cabernet is bone dry and strong in tannins, giving it an astringent mouthfeel. It's light in body for a Cabernet, with lots of acidity. However, it does have pretty flavors of blackberry and sour cherry candy.",88,50,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Not very successful, especially at this price. It's showing the weaknesses of Paso Cabernet. Although there's obviously ripe fruit, the wine has an awkward mouthfeel, with semisweet fruit flavors that finish with a green, peppermint jelly note.",84,35,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Not your average Zinfandel, this one could almost be a Syrah with all its peppery, meaty and smoky aromas and flavors. They are wild and different but puzzling. The wine is full-bodied, tannic and almost thick in texture.",85,32,California,Lodi,Zinfandel
US,"Notable for a soft, buttery creaminess that makes it feel caressing in the mouth. There's just enough acidity to give a boost to the intense lemondrop candy, pineapple, cr√®me brul√©e and vanilla flavors. Drink up with roast chicken, grilled salmon or portobello mushroom risotto.",87,22,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"Notable for balanced elegance, this Cabernet is dry and complex in blackberry, currant, cassis and plum flavors. Oak gives it a lovely jacket of smoke. It's tough in tannins, and unlikely to age, so drink over the next 2‚Äì3 years.",89,30,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Note the vintage‚Äî2009. This is already moving into maturity, loaded with berry-pie fruit flavors, especially blueberry. It's soft and drinking well, with cinnamon and baking spices in abundance. Don't delay‚Äîenjoy it over the next couple of years.",90,34,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"Notes of dried fig, citrus rind and tangerines are spiked with whiffs of potpourri and spice on this richly textured, unctuously sweet iced wine made from late-harvest grapes frozen after harvest. Creamy and lush on the finish, it's brightened by a shower of orange acidity and just a hint of black-tea astringency.",86,35,New York,Cayuga Lake,Riesling

US,"Notes of honeyed nut and yellow apple fill the nose, with traces of tropical fruit and white flower adding interest. The palate is light to medium bodied, and it offers fresh acidity. While the wine doesn't exude Viognier's exotic, voluptuous traits, it demonstrates the grape's restrained, elegant side.",86,22,Virginia,Shenandoah Valley,Viognier
US,"Notes of pollen and nuts lend an earthy warmth to aromas of lemon zest and honey tangerine on this brisk, vivacious Riesling. While dry in style, it's waxy and slick mouthfeel finishes with a ripple of spicy orange peel.",87,22,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
US,Notes of pressed apple and orange rind are brightened by splashes of lemon and spice in this robustly full-bodied wine. Savory apple and pear flavors lend a rustic tone but its mouth-clinging texture is lavish and lingering. It's a bold wine but balances neatly without any alcoholic heat.,87,17,New York,Hudson River Region,Chardonnay
US,Notes of pressed apple and tangerine peels abound in this full-bodied Chardonnay. Rounded edges and soft acidity make it approachably creamy. Drink now through 2019.,86,25,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Chardonnay
US,"Notes of ripe, fleshy red fruit on the nose and palate are grazed with hints of smoked meat, nuts and dried sage‚Äîan appetizing m√©lange of sweet and savory elements. While it's full bodied, the zesty acidity makes for a refreshing yet satisfying sip.",87,19,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc

US,"Nothing subtle about this big, ripe, oaky Chardonnay. It shows the tropical fruit richness of a fine Alexander Valley Chard, flamboyant in pineapple custard flavor, with a flinty minerality. The sweet overlay of smoky oak is perfectly in keeping with the wine's volume.",87,32,California,Alexander Valley,Chardonnay

The fruit is tight and structured, the wine angular and soft, with a seasoning of herb on the finish.",88,40,California,Sonoma Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Now officially labeled from the newly named Malibu Coast appellation, this bottling shows lots of potential for the region. Aromas of lush lemonade, crushed vanilla, browned butter, honeysuckle and honey lead into a soft and lush palate that's buttery but high-toned. Flavors of toasted bread with orange marmalade prove warm but tartly dynamic.",92,39,California,Malibu Coast,Chardonnay
US,"Now part of the Ste. Michelle Wine Estates portfolio, this pioneering Oregon winery seems to be holding firm to a clean, simple style of winemaking, as exemplified by this fresh and lightly fruity Pinot Gris.

US,"Now winemaker for Swanson, Robin Ackhurst excels here in this tiny production of his own wine, which exhibits exotic plum and juicy blackberry. A 100% varietal offering, it has a girth of structured tannin and toasty oak.",91,70,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"Oak and lees give rich, yeasty, butterscotchy complexities, and a creamy texture, to this fine young Chardonnay. Fortunately, the underlying varietal flavors are strong in pineapple, apple, honeydew and papaya. Only 500 cases were produced.",88,20,California,Livermore Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Oak and superripe fruit collaborate to make this wine taste like a fruity granola bar, with raspberries, blackberries, roasted almonds, caramel and cinnamon spices. It's a bit obvious now, too young and fresh for subtlety, especially at this price. Could develop nuances over time. Give it 5‚Äì6 years and try again.",87,90,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Oak barrel aging dominates,bringing buttered toast and caramel flavors. Underneath all that is a dry, tartly acidic wine, with complex tropical fruit, citrus and herb flavors. It might develop bottle complexity over the year four to five years. You can drink it now, but not too cold.",89,50,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Oak completely overwhelms this wine. All you can smell and taste is char, caramel and wood spice, and the tannins, which are partly from oak barrels, are dense and hard. It's difficult even to discern any underlying fruit flavors, although if you try hard, you stumble across blackberries.",82,50,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Oak dominates the palate with buttered toast and butterscotch flavors, as well as a buttered popcorn character, likely attributable to malolactic fermentation. The underlying fruits suggest pineapples and peach jam.",85,25,California,Carneros,Chardonnay

US,"Oak notes persist on the nose and palate of this Merlot, Petit Verdot, Cabernet Franc and Malbec blend. Heavy roast coffee, burnt toast and charred black-fruit flavors mark the full-bodied palate, while a zip of red currant acidity tries to shine through.",86,28,Virginia,Virginia,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"Oak stands out on this Chardonnay, offering buttered toast and vanilla flavors. The wine underneath is a little thin in fruit, but it has nice Monterey acidity.",85,25,California,Arroyo Seco,Chardonnay

US,"Oak stars in this wine, to its detriment. Underneath all that wood is a crisply elegant Chardonnay with ripe pear, peach and papaya flavors. But the oak plasters it with a ton of caramel and butterscotch that tastes excessive.",85,55,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay

US,"Oaky and smooth, this is already drinking well and is likely near or already at its peak. The Sangiovese fruit is lightly peppery and somewhat insubstantial, but the wine is harmonious and perfectly sound.",86,23,Washington,Yakima Valley,Sangiovese

US,"Occupying the bottom rung (in terms of cost) of the Columbia Crest ladder, Two Vines wines are generally light, quite clean and simple, with a minimum exposure to oak. This fits the mold, with flavors of strawberry chews and cotton candy. The tannins are also light and herbal, with an earthy, pleasantly leafy finish.",85,8,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Oddly acidic and hard in the mouth for Merlot, a variety that's supposed to be soft and silky. You'll find black cherry flavors, but not enough to punch through the tannins. Doesn't seem capable of aging, so drink up.",86,35,California,Calistoga,Merlot
US,"Oddly, Silver Lake's least expensive Merlot is its best. It's a solidly made, straight-ahead varietal wine, with a core of black olive and currant, stiff tannins and enough grip to hold up to hearty main meat dishes.",85,12,Washington,Rattlesnake Hills,Merlot

US,"Off dry it is, with flavors of Meyer lemon and black tea and plenty of acid. It is a fine value for the price, with density, concentration, purity of fruit and grip. Fruit runs through citrus into light tropical; the sugar falls out in the very finish but is balanced nicely against the acids.",90,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling

US,"Off-dry in taste, this wine has an intense sweet-and-sour flavor. It didn't undergo malolactic fermentation, so there's plenty of green-apple-like acidity, and as it partially fermented in barrel, there is a vanilla-cream-like sweetness.

US,"Offering a more traditional California Zinfandel style than some of the other 2011s, this takes off with scents of a warm, butter-crusted cherry pie, unfolding on the palate with cranberry jelly.

US,"One of the biggest, boldest, ripest Chardonnays in California, marked as usual by intense flavors, which the winemaker has boosted with oak. Just explodes in pineapple and apricot jam, tangerine custard and buttered toast, brightened by zesty acidity. The wine will age, gradually losing fruit and picking up roasted nut notes.",92,40,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
US,"One of the few California Malbecs that comes close to the dense fruit and sheer deliciousness of Argentine bottlings.

This is barbecue wine on steroids.",93,60,California,Napa Valley,Malbec

US,"One of the first 1999 Cabs on the market, this wine smells and tastes like the grapes were crushed yesterday. This is what middleweight Cabernet Sauvignon sans oak tastes like: all fresh blackberries and cherries, with undercurrants of espresso and sweet spice.

US,"One of the most satisfying Rieslings of the vintage.

US,"One of the richest Cabernets of the vintage. Amazingly soft and velvety in the mouth, yet there's a solid grip of acidity and tannins that balance the richness.

US,"One of three Chardonnays named after the winemaker's daughters, the aromas draw you into the glass, with notes of lees, almond, melted butter, cream, peach and spice.

US,"One thing you can depend on concerning Clos du Val's Cabernets is that they're elegant. The winery resolutely refuses to kowtow to the modern style of ultraripe, extracted fruit, high alcohol and massive oak.

US,"Pure, sappy wine juice is the impression this wine leaves. Although it's a 2010, it is so fresh and tangy it might have come straight from the tank. Pomegranate and raspberry are the fruit highlights, with hints of pepper and herb.",88,30,Washington,Yakima Valley,Cabernet Franc
US,"Purple and tannic, with a grapey aroma and a suggestion of dusty earth. The most interesting of RiverAerie's pure varietals, perhaps because of its high-toned, slightly volatile mouthfeel. Berry/cherry fruit comes through sharply, then quickly fades into herbal tannins.",86,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Malbec
US,"Purple fruit and wood spice intermingle on the aromas, along with clove, herb and baking spice, showing a touch of volatility. The fruit flavors are big and bold, bringing a sense of structure and liveliness. It's an intriguing example of the variety from an up-and-coming vineyard.",89,41,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Malbec
US,"Put this Chardonnay in a blind tasting with Chards two or three times its price, and it will easily hold its own. It's dry, crisp and balanced, with a creamy mouthfeel framing Meyer lemon, lime, pineapple and papaya flavors. What a great price for such a sophisticated Chardonnay.",91,18,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Put this one in the cellar for a good six years, at the very least. Right now, it's tight and tannic, with dramatically layered blackberry, currant, dark chocolate, mint and cedar flavors.",93,40,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Puts out hot country scents of baked cherry pie, pie crust, and tar, and those hot notes continue in the mouth. There's something Port-like in the raisiny flavors and thick texture. Turns semi-sweet on the finish.",82,20,California,Lodi,Pinotage
US,"Quietly fruity and rather soft-textured, this wine smells lightly herbal and tastes dry. Light honeydew flavors give a little extra interest.",85,13,California,Mendocino County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Quietly, Hewitt flies below the radar, often producing Cabernets that, while not cheap, rival their pricier competition. Consider their '09 a deal. It's dry, smoothly tannic and complex, offering waves of black cherry jam, mocha, licorice and smoky oak. You can drink this lovely wine now, but it should develop in the bottle over the next 10 years.",94,85,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Quilceda makes big, muscular Cabernets, but the power is tightly controlled and never out of whack. Firm cherry fruit is edged with mixed spices from barrel aging. Still young and hard, this is a tannic wine that clearly has the stuffing and structure to age indefinitely, but if drunk now will require many hours of breathing time. Editors' Choice.",93,60,Washington,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Quince, lemon peel and honeydew make for compatible bedfellows in this no-oak white, which is light and inviting on the palate, with more underlying herbal flourishes than it first lets on. Dry and daring, it'll pair well with all manner of fresh seafood.",90,25,California,Alexander Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Quince, lime and white peach fruit flavors suggest that this was sourced from relatively cool sites. Some skin flavors are in evidence, providing extra length and definition. The finish is balanced, with a touch of heat.",88,19,Washington-Oregon,,Roussanne
US,"Quince, orange, pink grapefruit and other citrus fruits are rounded off with a slight suggestion of residual sugar. There's a touch of almond in the finish, which lingers gracefully.",91,23,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Blanc
US,"Quite a bit of spicy, sweet-seeming oak flavors give this full-bodied wine an extravagant flair to match its rather hot mouthfeel and firm tannins.",85,30,California,Amador County,Cabernet Franc
US,"Quite a bit of Tempranillo is being planted in southern Oregon, and it shows considerable promise. The flavors here suggest cherry cobbler, with ripe fruit at the center. There are streaks of citrus and a touch of toast in the mix, with drying tannins.",87,26,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Tempranillo
US,"Quite a good Cabernet, showing the elegance and ripe fruitiness you expect from Napa, in a style for drinking now. Drily tannic, it shows classic blackberry and blueberry flavors.",89,30,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Quite a good Cabernet, virgorous and dry, with an earthy edge of sweet, dried herbs alongside the blackberries and cedar. More elegant and food-friendly than many of the fruitier, high alcohol, oaky Cabs out there.",92,50,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Quite a good Chardonnay for the price. Shows classic flavors of pineapples, pears and apples, enriched with smoky oak and vanilla, and folded into a creamy texture. Good value, and easy to find, with 7,800 cases produced.",89,14,California,Lake County,Chardonnay
US,"Quite a steal for lovers of this variety, this wine shows green apple, kiwi, chalk and a sharp lime-peel edge on the nose. The palate offers flavors of grapefruit and Key lime wedges, but the real winning aspects are the white pepper spice and the rain-on-cement minerality.",88,15,California,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Quite an impressive young Chardonnay, with brisk acidity, a tangy minerality and a bone dry finish. You'll find suggestions of pineapple, Meyer lemon, lime and kiwi flavors, with a kiss of smoky oak. Chill it well, then savor it as it warms in the glass.",92,28,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Quite buttery and nutty on the nose, this wine shows Marcona almonds, seared pineapple, cr√®me br√ªl√©e and vanilla custard. Those elements meet with smart amounts of acid and texture on each creamy, buttery, pineapple-laced sip, which then finishes on marshmallow flavors.",90,35,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Quite dark and dense, generous and ripe, this Grenache offers a mix of red and black fruits. The flavors continue onto a finish that's rich with kirsch and coffee.",90,26,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Grenache
US,"Quite dark in the glass, this blend of 78% Cabernet Sauvignon, 12% Cabernet Franc, 6% Petit Verdot and 4% Merlot starts with snappy boysenberry aromas and grows more savory with dust and dried pine needle notes. The palate's acidity is expertly integrated, carrying charred blueberry, minty dill and cocoa flavors.",91,38,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Quite dark in the glass, this bottling boasts cedar-driven aromas augmented with rust, strawberry, leather and lava rock scents. The palate leads with cigar-like tobacco notes, building toward heavy red fruit and framed by sticky tannins.",86,30,California,Santa Clara Valley,Sangiovese
US,"Quite distinct from the winery's regular Pinot Gris, this is oak fermented and barrel aged on the lees for 16 months. The hock bottle suggests an Alsatian model, the extended barrel time softening the sharp acidity. There's a light suggestion of wood flavor, not toast but neutral wood, and the fruit is damped down. However, with extra aeration this wine springs to life, with complex highlights of wood, herb and stone.",91,35,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"Quite dry and thin, with an odd mix of unripe fruit, sugary fruit, toasted seed and plastic. Just doesn't sit well in the mouth.",82,24,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Merlot
US,"Quite dry yet intensely fruity, this has loads of fresh strawberry, red cherry and raspberry flavors. This finishes with a touch of sweet fruit and a subtle spray of cherry blossom perfume. It's an unabashedly quaffable ros√© that's perfect for entertaining year round. Drink now.",89,13,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc
US,"Quite dry, crisp and lean, this wine is a great palate refresher that will pair well with raw oysters or goat cheese. It has bright citrus flavors, light body and a tangy finish.",89,18,California,Lake County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Quite elegant, but not showing well given the price, being somewhat soft and direct in candied blackberries, cherries and chocolate-covered mint. The vintage was a difficult one for St. Sup√©ry. The wine is lacks the stuffing for ageability. Drink now‚Äì2013.",87,65,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Quite firm and focused, with a dominating scent of cut tobacco. The black cherry fruit is set against juicy acids, and rolls into a finish with streaks of licorice and more of that cut tobacco flavor.",87,15,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Quite fruity and fairly rich, this medium-bodied wine has plenty of apple, lime and dried herb flavors, and a fairly crisp but smooth texture. More than just a thirst-quencher, it brings some heft to the table.",86,18,California,Lake County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Quite good and rich in jammy berry, cherry, cassis and oak flavors, but there's a certain obvious appeal that lacks complexity, and it's not what you expect from a wine of this reputation and price. This bottling has been falling off from the glories of the 1990s for some years now. A pity. Hopefully the trend will reverse. Production was 9,008 cases.",87,115,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Quite grassy and brisk in style, this wine releases generous aromas of cut tennis ball, wet cement and sour limes. That citrusy acidity and sour-grass energy picks up lime pith, green-apple skins and a touch of white pepper on the palate, a very classic profile.",88,24,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Sauvignon Blanc

US,"Quite green out of the gate, the aromas display notes of savory herbs, cedar and spice, with a reduced note that blows off. The plum and dark-fruit flavors are tart and elegant with dry tannins that don't seem to have fully ripened. It has potential at the dinner table but doesn't quite stand up on its own.",88,19,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Quite intense aromas of plum brandy and kirsch are boosted with scents of iron and black pepper on this bottling. The palate shows stewed cherries and strawberries, and there is both acidity and tannic grip, proving this to be a complete and solid wine.",88,40,California,Carmel Valley,Cabernet Franc
US,"Quite light in aroma at first, this is a delicate, lithe and lovely bottling, showing lemon and yellow pear tones on the nose. That sensibility carries to the palate, where touches of yellow apple, sea salt, faint banana and a shred of bubblegum converge for a complete yet restrained white wine experience.",91,25,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Quite light in color, especially for the alcohol level, this wine offers dried red cherries, hibiscus, rose petals, pencil shavings and a touch of hot asphalt on the spicy and fun nose. Lots of lively red fruit energy comes forth once sipped, with nutmeg, clove spice, ginger snaps and molasses flavors rounding out a memorable pour.",93,21,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
US,"Quite light in color, the aromas bring initially locked up but then broadly expansive notes of peat, green olive, white pepper, strawberry, Stargazer lilies, mineral and herb, showing a lot of complexity. The palate is textured, bringing a profound mixture of fruit and savory flavors that intertwine effortlessly on the long finish. It brings a sense of tension, texture and finesse that is completely captivating.",94,75,Oregon,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Grenache
US,"Quite light in the glass, the aromas on this bottling are also a bit weak, with cinnamon and red fruits emerging with patience. It's light and lithe on the palate, with candied cherry, rose petals and tons of cracked pepper making for a lengthy, grippy sip.",88,38,California,Central Coast,Grenache
US,"Quite light in the glass, this wine offers crisp and tight aromas of Japanese pear, peach blossom and custard torte. It's light and easy on the palate, with honeysuckle and cooked-apple flavors cut by lemon juice.",87,20,California,Temecula,Viognier

US,"Quite powerful and oaky in style, this full-bodied wine matches ripeness with firm tannins, carrying a hint of brown-sugar sweetness from the aroma through the finish. It's dry, but the spicy effect of new-oak barrels adds a pastry-like accent, which the texture balances with a welcome bite of astringency.",89,30,California,Mendocino,Cabernet Sauvignon

A preserved lemon element and sour orange character mark the nose, with touches of marzipan yet lacking the usually associated creaminess.",86,30,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Chardonnay
US,"Quite ripe and fruity, this full-bodied wine brings apple, pear and peach fruit in abundance. It's almost over-the-top, with some noticeable heat on the finish.",87,18,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Blanc
US,"Quite ripe, verging on overripe, showing flavors of blackberries, black currants and cedar, with a very slight raisining on the finish. Shows good integration of oak and fruit, housed in firm tannins that are astringent in youth. Should develop bottle maturity for six years or so, at least.",90,60,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Quite roasty-toasty, this is heavily scented with coffee and smoke. Smooth tannins surround plummy fruit, and there is enough concentration for a good, long finish.

US,"Quite tart, the fruit here touches (just barely) on melon, with orange and lemon zest, a bit of lime, and plenty of acid. All stainless fermented, it went through full malolactic.",87,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"Quite thin, as if over-cropped, turning the fruit generic. Then it brings in a honey character, as if it were botrytis-affected. But it is not a sweet or late harvest wine; it's quite dry.",82,12,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"Quite tropical on the extremely dense nose, with guava nectar and honey aromas, this late-harvest wine is extremely sweet and treacly on the palate, without showing much complexity. It's like drinking liquid sugar.",85,22,California,Paso Robles,Moscato

US,"Raspingly dry and fierce in tannins, this Merlot is quite different from other Bordeaux-style red wines from Oakville that are ripe and lush.

US,"Raw oak is the dominant scent, which overlays a less intense cherry aroma. It feels medium bodied, with a certain flatness about its core. Acidity lends the finish some zip, but it lacks focus overall, ending on a hazy mocha note.",83,29,Virginia,Virginia,Cabernet Franc
US,"Raw pastry dough, blackberry jam and vanilla aromatics are offset by cigar box and leather notes. Compared to Rappahannock's nonreserve 2010 Cabernet Franc, this wine feels warmer due to its alcohol, which is more than 1% higher than the nonreserve bottling.

Next comes a leaner sense of chalk and Key lime rind. The palate shows buttered apple richness alongside lime and lemon acidity throughout the sip, with a touch of baking soda and more salt on the finish.",89,28,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
US,"Sea salt and dried honey dust season the cement and chalky minerality on the nose of this always-reliable bottling from the longtime downtown Santa Barbara producer.

US,"Sestina celebrates old-vine Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc from the Red Willow and Bacchus vineyards. The initial punch and power gives way to a wine with sharp acidity and somewhat constrained, leafy fruit flavors.

Tight and focused, it responds well to several hours of decanting.",91,55,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"Shows the Von Strasser signature all down the line, with incredibly extracted blackberry jam, cassis liqueur, dark chocolate and new French oak flavors, wrapped into hard tannins and brightened with fine acidity. Only the second release from this young vineyard, it's an intensely interesting, complex wine that will reward cellaring. Best after 2019.",94,80,California,Diamond Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Shows the weakness of certain Napa Valley Chardonnays, with a dry herbaceous taste that accentuates the acidity and even the tannins. Although there are pineapple and oak flavors, the wine lacks interest.",85,32,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"Shows the winery's characteristic green, tart gooseberry flavors and zesty acidity. There's a richer streak of grapefruits and pineapples. It's an elegant wine whose low alcohol, below 13%, doesn't prevent it from being dry.",87,18,California,Rutherford,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Shows those classic, old-fashioned Howell Mountain tannins that lock the wine down and make it more or less undrinkable in youth. There are some good black currant flavors, but they're not really powerful, and have herbal notes alongside. That makes the future of this wine a question.",86,60,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Shows very bright acidity and a firm minerality, which gives it a tangy, mouthwatering vitality. Rich, too, in lemondrop candy, pineapple jam and spice flavors. The oak has been tastefully applied, with just- right notes of buttered toast. A flattering, balanced, elegant Chardonnay for drinking soon.",93,30,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Chardonnay

US,"Showy and rich, it features lots of tasty oak influence and ripe, generous fruit flavors, but it doesn't go over the top. This is full-bodied, broad in texture and not too tannic. Made from mature, hillside vines, it's especially impressive in this challenging vintage.",90,34,California,Lake County,Zinfandel

US,"Shy on the nose, this 100% Chardonnay from the winery's Vineburg and Firetree vineyards is entirely barrel-fermented and the oak shows mostly on the finish. On the palate, expect ripe pear, Good & Plenty licorice and a slight zippiness.",87,28,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"Shy on the nose, this wine has dry, sticky tannins that cling to a wall of high-toned red fruit, mostly plum, forming a medium weight on the palate. Softening out as it goes, it leaves black pepper on the finish.",86,30,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
US,"Shy, timid notes of white peach and tropical fruit are offset by hints of vanilla and nutty biscuit. It feels medium to full bodied, but this lacks intensity and concentration overall. A touch of spice on the midpalate adds interest.",83,28,Virginia,Monticello,Chardonnay

US,"Side-by-side, Sheldrake Point's two Riesling ice wines are a fascinating study of how yeast affects flavors in wine. This regular-label ice wine, fermented with inoculated yeast, has a sunny, sweet charm. Notes of pressed apple, warming spice and potpourri perfume lend a cider-like tone. The palate lingers, countering bright, lemony acidity with a long peach kiss.",90,60,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
US,"Silverado has a mixed track record with Sauvignon Blanc, a difficult variety to get right in Napa Valley, as it's very vintage specific. It tastes a little on the sweet side, bearing flavors of green peas and oranges, with a savory spiciness.",87,22,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc

US,"Simple and fruity, this has a mix of pineapple, citrus and apple, high-toned and slightly bitter. The toasty component from some sort of barrel/oak treatment is not yet integrated into the fruit. This will need decanting or aging in bottle until 2016.",86,18,Oregon,Oregon,Chardonnay

It's a bold, densely fruity wine full of luscious black cherry, plum and currant flavors.

US,"Some hints of sweetness and a touch of minerality annotate this wine, which bursts with flavors of peaches and tangerines. It's dry enough to pair with most Riesling friendly fare, and in many ways the most accessible and fruit-forward of Trisaetum's eight Rieslings.",92,28,Oregon,Ribbon Ridge,Riesling
US,"Some may find this too cool-climate for the grape, but the green peppercorns, fresh-crushed thyme, dried parsley and papilla chile aromas prove remarkably pleasant and inviting. The herbs extend to the palate, which is leveled by red cherry and blueberry fruits, some slate and turned earth, and rustic elderberry jam. It has great density.",89,25,California,Santa Barbara County,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Some nice toasty flavors underscore generic fruit. When all is said and done, it is a neutral, crisp white wine enlivened with a bit of spice and toast from the barrel aging. Still, a bit of veggie/canned pea flavor dampens the finish.",84,15,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Semillon-Chardonnay

US,"Some of the region's oldest Dijon clone plantings are in this wine, done in a firm, classy style with little new wood apparent.

If you drink it now, give it a few hours in the decanter.",89,92,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"Some will find this Chardonnay severe and lacking in richness as it's marked by dryness, minerality and acidity, rather than tropical fruit and sweet oak.It would not be surprising if this wine made gains in 5‚Äì6 years, but even if it doesn't, it defines a more elegant style.",92,50,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Chardonnay
US,"Some wines are meant for immediate consumption. Others require age. This wonderful wine satisfies on both sides. It's softly rich and polished in tannins, with accessible blackberry, cassis and oak flavors. Yet it has the structure and depth to go for years. Now‚Äì2016, at least.",95,90,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Some wines fall outside the tasting box, and this is one of those. Intense, rich and distinctive‚Äîit's not your father's Chardonnay. Spontaneous fermentation (through native yeast) contributes to the texture and density. Concentrated fruit suggests nectarines, Meyer lemon and candied oranges just on the edge of being overripe. Drink now through 2018.",91,30,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Somehow, this fine winery gets left off a lot of ‚Äúbest of‚Äù lists, which makes it a great value, especially from a super vintage like ‚Äò97. This is serious Napa Cabernet, filled with fancy black currant, cassis and mocha, and complex with toasty oak. It's very dry and elegant, one of those wines that fills the palate with the most sumptuous flavors and textures. It's so focused, it's delicious now, but there's no doubt it will age and improve for a long time.",92,25,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Something different and almost irrestible, this red dessert wine is high in alcohol but still comes off as a table wine in flavor, but with obvious, tasty sweetness. Beyond that the flavors and slight grip of tannins seem like those of a big red wine.",92,50,California,Red Hills Lake County,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Something is lacking in this, which has a dominant aroma of baked bread and savory mushrooms. Tannic and oaky, its year spent in American oak, 30% of that new, hasn't done it many favors.",84,22,California,Lake County,Primitivo
US,"Something special from the west side of the Salinas Valley, with its fogs and wind. Drinks very bright in acids and even some tannins that frame a melange of flavors, including sweet lime, green apple, and the ripest white peach. Tastes leesy and has the texture of sweet cream. This distinctive wine defines Monterey's interpretation of Chardonnay.",93,35,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
US,"Sometimes Franc can have a lovely, alluringly floral bouquet; other times it can be downright vegetal and display green-bean characteristics. Unfortunately, this is an example of the latter. The wine has nice weight and texture, so if you don't mind your veggies in liquid form this might be more to your liking.",80,19,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Cabernet Franc
US,"Somewhat closed, the nose of this offering shows some red berry, currants and anise. An evenly textures palate, more of the fruits evidenced on the nose with slight pepperiness mark a classic Zinfandel profile. The finish is moderately tannic, and the wine has the potential to evolve for a year or two.",86,23,California,California,Zinfandel
US,"Somewhat light in color, this is an aromatically appealing wine that shows a complex assortment of coffee, vanilla, pencil lead, cherry, blueberry and high-toned herbal notes. It's exquisitely polished in its styling, with plush tannins and a long, lingering finish.

US,"Sommeliers will appreciate this Chardonnay for its dryness and elegance, not to mention the price. It favors restraint over flamboyance, yet offers plenty of rich tropical and citrus fruits, with hints of honey and minerals. The alcohol is refreshingly balanced.",90,26,California,Sonoma Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Sommeliers will love this Chardonnay for its lean, Chablis-like elegance. The lemon and passion fruit flavors stand alongside stony minerality and a leesy, sourdough bread tartness, while the brisk acidity makes the mouth water. Elegant rather than opulent, this gathers momentum as it warms in the glass.",91,50,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"Sommeliers will love this wine for its elegance, and the way it's happy to stand back and support food, rather than star at the table. It's dry, medium bodied and tannic, with cherry, red currant, cocoa and sweet oak flavors. Drink over the next 2‚Äì3 years.",88,33,California,Carneros,Merlot

Good tension between tannins and bitterness leads to a mouthwatering finish.",91,34,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Grenache
US,"Soos Creek's value-priced Sundance Red really shines in 2010. A Bordeaux-style blend of 50% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot and 19% Cabernet Franc, it rivals the top-tier efforts from any number of wineries. Plum, cherry, cassis and chocolate flavors are leavened with a dash of herb. Tannins are dusty and detailed, and the wine has the stuffing to age over the next half decade or more.",92,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"Sour plum, dried herb, pepper and tar scents show on the nose of this bottling from the widely available brand. The palate is tightly wound with sticky tannins, which are like to mellow with time, allowing the coffee, asphalt, elderberry and black currant flavors to shine more brightly.",87,25,California,Monterey County,G-S-M
US,"Sour red-cherry and tart cassis notes abound on this brisk, slightly puckery Bordeaux blend. Medium bodied in style, it's refreshing on the palate with a cool mineral tone, but could benefit from a boost of concentration.",85,25,New York,Finger Lakes,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"Sourced entirely from the Bacchus vineyard, this is an uneasy mix of dry and sweet, as if both styles were trying to come out in a single wine.

US,"Sourced from a 35-year-old vineyard with views of the San Francisco Bay, this wine offers aromas of toasted oak, marshmallow, green pear and wet rock. The wood is quickly wiped out by brisk acidity on the palate, but then emerges again on the creamy finish.

Drink from 2016 till well beyond.",92,85,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Sourced from an eastern Oregon vineyard, XIX includes retired NFL great Keyshawn Johnson as one of the partners. Packaged in a massively heavy bottle, this pure Cabernet is well along the aging curve after spending 18 months in Hungarian oak and some years in bottle.

US,"Still spritzy, very tart and tangy, with orange peel and lemon drop flavors.

US,"TA firm minerality, like the tang of cold steel, derives from Spring Mountain's soil. That metallic note adds an interesting dimension to the wine's fruitier flavors of apricots, mangoes and peaches. The winemaker added some Oak Knoll fruit,  which contributes citrus acidity for balance.",88,32,California,Spring Mountain District,Chardonnay
US,"Take a few bucks off the price, and this would be a good value. As things stand, this Chardonnay, which is a blend of Santa Clara Valley and Santa Cruz Mountains fruit, is fairly standard. It's dry and crisp, with pleasant lemon-custard flavors that turn a little unripe on the finish.",85,20,California,Central Coast,Chardonnay
US,"Takes the popular route, with caramelized oak and ripe fruit that taste sweet. Almost like a dessert wine, showing tangerine, vanilla and buttered toast flavors that pall after a sip or two.",84,25,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Tamarack blends grapes from an astonishing number of sites scattered across the length and breadth of the Columbia Valley, and yet makes wines that are distinctive, polished, generous, and focused. The 2008 Merlot includes 5% each Cabernet Sauvignon and Cab Franc. Its structure is firmly Cab-like, its fruit broadly displayed across the midpalate, a mix of ripe strawberries and cherries dusted with sweet baking spices and cocoa. It's a joyride from start to finish.",92,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"Tan spice, like sandalwood, plays a leading role, along with a touch of Meyer lemon and marshmallow. Stone fruit notes are currently in the background, but may emerge more with time.",87,13,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
US,"Tangy acidity is the star here. It gives structure and backbone to the lemon, lime, pineapple and fig flavors, and makes the wine a great cocktail sipper.",85,16,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Tangy aromas of lemon curd meet with warmer touches of Marcona almonds and cider-laced popcorn on the dynamic nose of this bottling. The palate starts with a melted butter richness before tangy citrus peels and savory sea salts combine for a long finish, where both butterscotch and vanilla also make an appearance.",92,40,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"Tangy citrus and crisp green apple aromas and flavors light up this snappy wine. It smells like lemon and grapefruit with a typical touch of grassiness, and tastes lively, similar to lemon and grapefruit zest, but not too tart. It's medium bodied and finishes smoothly.",88,19,California,Lake County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Tangy grapefruit and gooseberry flavors make this new wine from Jackson Family Estates lively, fresh and palate-cleansing. It has medium body, good concentration and bracing acidity.",90,17,California,North Coast,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Tangy red fruit sits atop leathery texture in this dark, brooding wine, blended with 13% Petit Verdot and 4% Malbec. Violets and blueberries play on the palate while integrated oak and tannin lend body and power to the proceedings. The finish is smoky.",91,60,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tannat is a rarity anywhere in the USA, but especially in Oregon. Yet it does well at this southern location, producing a full-bodied and forward wine with a potent flavor mix of black fruit and leather, cedar and espresso. The highlights of smoke and charred wood are unrestrained, yet work well with the ample fruit packed into the core. This wine begs for a charcoal-grilled steak.",89,29,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Tannat
US,"Tannic and closed now, this wine has a tough-as-nails astringency that brings to mind an older style of Howell Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon, one that required many years of aging. However, this wine is considerably riper and fruitier than anything the mountain used to yield, testimony to modern growing and extractive measures. It is, in a word, delicious, with deep, long blackberry, black currant, cr√®me de cassis and smoke flavors. But, like the 2007, it needs serious time in the cellar. Try after 2018.",94,100,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tannic and fruity, with the taste of an energy bar. The flavors suggest ripe blackberries, anise, almonds, honey, pepper and dark chocolate. Drink now.",85,27,California,Mendocino County,Merlot
US,"Tannic and powerfully built, Muscardini's Sangiovese veers into slightly sour-currant territory and offers a long, leathery finish.",86,36,California,Redwood Valley,Sangiovese
US,"Tapteil, Ciel and Cara Mia vineyard fruit, a blend of 35% Cabernet Sauvignon, 31% Merlot, 28% Cab Franc and 6% Petit Verdot. Young and tight, with the characteristic Cadence chalk and stone undertone. The fruit is pretty strawberry, with a peppery herbal streak, good length and fine balance.",88,25,Washington,Red Mountain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Tar, dried meat, olallieberry and sharp cedar aromas show on this blend of 51% Cabernet Sauvignon and 49% Merlot. Dried strawberries and plums mix with thyme and dried rose petals on the palate.",87,18,California,Paso Robles,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Tar, tobacco and smoke can't mask the green tomato leaf characteristics on this ruby red Sangiovese. There are some interesting spice notes, but not a lot of ripeness or concentration in the fruit.",81,29,New York,Finger Lakes,Sangiovese
US,"Tart and acidic, this does not entirely disguise its green-bean scents with aging in French oak, 30% new. That sweet oak sticks out, but the tannins are chalky and the fruit hard to find.",86,32,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tart and dry, this has a broad flavor that does not express much varietal specificity, with some notes of caramel and butter. Not yet knit together, this could improve significantly with further bottle age.",85,28,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Blanc
US,"Tart and fruity, this Riesling bears flavors of apple and white peach, with an extra dimension of citrus rind. Balanced and lively, the fruit rules the day.",88,14,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Riesling
US,"Tart and juicy, this nicely balanced Riesling mixes fruit flavors of orange, Meyer lemon and tangerine. The acids are natural and tangy, and the overall balance is just right.",88,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
US,"Tart and juicy, with wild raspberry fruit streaked with dried herb and just hinting at black cherry. This is a subtle yet powerful wine, with whiffs of smoke, licorice and coffee, but far less noticeable barrel influence than its companion reds. Focused and pure, with the structure to age.",92,75,Washington,Snipes Mountain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Tart and lemony, without anything to elevate it above the crowd. Some slight butterfat flavors hint at malolactic fermentation, but it falls flat in the finish.",84,7,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
US,"Tart and lively, this medium-bodied Sangiovese was co-fermented with small amounts of Syrah and Viognier. The Viognier contributes scents of citrus and stone fruit, which add some welcome complexity.",87,30,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Sangiovese
US,"Tart and nervy, this cool-climate Cabernet Sauvignon bristles with fresh cranberry and sour-cherry flavors. Concentrated with red fruit yet touched with complexities of granite and steel, it's an elegant choice for lighter chicken or duck dishes.",87,37,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tart and puckery, this is for acid-lovers. The aromas carry accents of pine needles, while the fruit is headlined with grapefruit and tangy citrus. Very refreshing.",88,19,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"Tart and racy, this sets up the palate for spicy fare with bracing acids and scents of citrus skins. It is the first-ever Riesling for A to Z, a nod perhaps to the growing demand for these wines, especially on the West Coast. Flavors mix citrus, white flowers, strawberries and spice, with a finishing lick of minerality.",88,13,Oregon,Oregon,Riesling
US,"Tart and sharply-defined, this single-vineyard effort offers edgy flavors of melon, apple, pineapple and jicama. The vineyard's signature minerality is evident as well.",88,23,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Roussanne
US,"Tart and snappy, the flavors of lime flesh and rind dominate. Some green pineapple pokes through, with crisp acidity underscoring the flavors. The wine was all stainless-steel fermented.",87,14,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"Tart and tangy in orange and lime, this wine conveys an undeniable freshness that one won't soon forget, with a bright, focused acidity at its core. Mouthwateringly succulent in lemon custard and brioche as it develops and lengthens in the glass, it offers the best of vibrancy and voluptuousness.",93,60,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Tart and tangy, these recently grafted Riesling vines deliver just-ripe flavors of Meyer lemon, lime, grapefruit and pineapple. It's close to a fruit bomb, but the significant acid underpinning keeps it juicy and gives it extra lift.",92,28,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Riesling
US,"Tart and tangy, with cleansing acidity, this is a Pinot Gris ready for fresh shellfish, oysters, and mussels. The lemony fruit is marked by a touch of pineapple, showing good focus, concentration and length.",90,18,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"Tart cherry, ripe plum and black cherry flavors and barely a trace of detectable oak character make this a lively, fruit-driven wine. The aroma has touches of clove and black pepper, the texture is not too rich but braced with firm acidity and tannins that keep the fruit flavors zooming along through the finish.",91,18,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Zinfandel
US,"Tart green apple fruit flavors dominate, with high acids and perhaps a hint of light toast. Simple and straightforward.",86,19,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
US,"Tart lemon verbena is highlighted in taste and aroma in this structured, elegant and zesty wine. Textured and medium bodied, it finishes with some graceful weight.",90,25,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Tart raspberry acidity casts an electric vibe onto ripe blackberry and cherry flavors in this wine. It's vivaciously fruity and lushly textured yet firmly structured, held upright by fine-grained, penetrating tannins. The finish is brisk and clean.",89,27,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Cabernet Franc
US,"Tart to the edge of sour, this is made for hot weather drinking. Lemon, lime and sour orange fruit with plenty of acidity and a solid, clean, crisp finish.",87,15,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Blanc
US,"Tart to the point of being flat-out sour, this might appeal to lovers of rhubarb pie. Rhubarb and sour plum flavors are matched with sharp acidity. The fruit seems underripe.",84,28,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Primitivo
US,"Tart with acidity but lush with fruit, this is a lovely Chardonnay to drink with shellfish dishes. Honeyed notes accompany flavors of tropical fruit, Meyer lemon and lime. Oak lends touches of vanilla and a creaminess that finishes clean.",91,34,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
US,"Tart yellow plum and red apples build in concentration from nose to palate. Sumptuously semidry, it's pleasantly honeyed with a subtle violet candy sweetness. The finish is moderately long.",88,14,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
US,"Tart, firm and simple, this wine lacks complexity and structure somewhat, providing quiet flavors of leather saddle and cedar amongst a soft rounded tannin profile.",86,48,California,Dry Creek Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tart, penetrating notes of lime, green apple and greengage plum accentuate the cool, crisp quality of this dry Riesling. It's zingy and lean in constitution, but concentrated and complex in flavors, shaded with deep tones of earth and mineral that seem omnipresent in Bloomer Creek's 2013 vintage.",89,26,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
US,"Tart, tangy lemon flavor meets green apple and quince in this lush, oaky wine. Its texture is robust.",85,26,California,Sonoma Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Tart, with brambly berry fruit, and even a bit of apricot. This was a cool year in Walla Walla, and the fruit flavors reflect that.",87,40,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tartness and moderate tannins lend plenty of mouth-puckering grip to this medium-bodied wine, and that tartness comes off as a touch of raspberry vinegar on the palate. It has an appealing earthy, iron-like quality and a definite textural bite.",86,39,California,Amador County,Primitivo
US,"Tasted alongside far more expensive Napa Cabs, this 100% varietal performed well. It's front loaded with blackberry jam that's jacked up with sweet, smoky oak. With a production of 15,000 cases, it's easy to find this smoothly tannic wine. Drink now.",89,25,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tasted alongside far more expensive Napa Cabs, this one held its own proudly. It shows impressive blackberry, currant and mint flavors, with a smoky, ashy overlay of oak. The firm tannins suggest modest ageability. Drink this dry, balanced Cab now through 2010.",87,20,California,Mount Veeder,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tasted at the age of 38 months, Erba's Bordeaux blend is a dense, tannicly dry wine. It has well-ripened flavors of blackberries, currants, mocha and cedar. If you drink it now, decant. Best before 2011, before the fruit falls out.",88,50,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Tasted in a flight of other '04 Rutherford Cabs, this one was a little leaner and greener. There's a pepperminty sharpness alongside the cherry and cedar flavors. Best now and for a few years.",88,75,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tasted in August, crisp acidity gave this Chardonnay a slight effervescence that may disappear by the time you taste it. The sparkliness, however, actually is a welcome balance to rich, ripe pineapple, peach, vanilla and buttered toast flavors.",85,25,California,Arroyo Grande Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Tasted in early December, this Cabernet, which was blended with Merlot and Petit Verdot, was in a funny place in its evolution. It's not exactly fresh and fruity, but it hasn't evolved to the complexity of an aged wine. You'll find plenty of restrained blackberry, cherry, currant, violet, oak and tannic notes that require another 6‚Äì8 years to resolve and shine.",92,65,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tasted in late August, there was a spritziness that may well disappear by the time this wine is available on the market. That fizziness is by no means unattractive. It brings a bright, Champagne-like kick to the Meyer-lemon, lime, apricot and papaya flavors that make this Sauvignon Blanc so savory.",88,18,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Tasted in October, this still-young Merlot is tannic and jammy. It shows fresh primary fruit flavors of raspberries, cherries and blackberries that are a bit one-dimensional. Give it until mid-2008 to develop some bottle complexity.",86,25,California,Sonoma County,Merlot
US,"Tasted in September ‚Äò07, this Cab was pretty high in tannins, giving it a tough astringency some folks won't like. But the wine is clean and complex, with blackberry, tobacco and sage flavors. It's the opposite of a cult Cabernet, which is to say it's more like a traditional dry Bordeaux than something out of Napa.",87,20,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tasted in the late summer of 2010, this Cab was pretty tannic and acidic, despite some very rich and dynamic blackberry, black cherry, currant and licorice flavors. It will hit its peak sometime in the next 2‚Äì3 years.",86,40,California,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tasted just after bottling, the wine was a little bottle-shocked, but should be fine by Summer 2010. Rich and creamy, with complex tropical fruit, buttered toast, lemondrop candy and honeysuckle flavors. An amazing 111,000 cases were produced.",90,21,California,Monterey-Santa Barbara,Chardonnay

US,"Tasted shortly after bottling, this needed some airing to blow off the sulfur. Once open it showed itself to be a palate-pleasing, round and spicy wine, elaborating its pear fruit with notes of orange peel and Meyer lemon.",88,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"Tasted twice, with divergent results; the 86 rating reflects the average of both bottles. One bottle seemed overly heavy, with an odd mix of jalape√±o peppers and honey. The better (and hopefully more representative) bottle showed richness without excessive weight, hints of cream and toast and penetrating citrus flavors, and would have rated 89 points on its own.",86,23,California,Santa Barbara County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Tastes a bit forward and simple right now in cherry pie filling, raspberry tart, framboise and orange datenut cookie flavors, with a silky texture and fine, ripe tannins. Could develop interesting bottle complexities over the next 6‚Äì8 years.",87,35,California,Santa Barbara County,Grenache
US,"Tastes a bit old and tired for a Zin that's less than 4 years of age, but on the plus side is the light, silky texture and complex flavors of dried berries and red currants, cola, cocoa, anise and black peppercorn.",86,40,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
US,"Tastes and smells hot, with a burnt rubber note that persists through the tart, peppery finish. The wine is very dry, with little fruit.",82,14,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tastes as sweet as a dessert wine, with caramelized new oak and sugary pineapple, orange and apricot jam flavors, brightened with crisp acidity. Will appeal to those who like this style.",84,18,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Tastes as sweet as Lifesaver lemon and pineapple candy, with low acidity.",81,8,California,California,Chardonnay
US,"Tastes considerably fruitier and more full bodied than your typical Sangiovese, no doubt because winemaker Mitch Cosentino added Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc to the blend. The wine retains Sangiovese's acidity and sour cherry flavors, but the Bordeaux varieties bring layers of blackberries, cassis and chocolate to this dry, elegant wine.",88,28,California,Napa Valley,Sangiovese
US,"Tastes frankly sweet, with sugary flavors of pineapple marmalade, vanilla custard and butterscotch. It's clean in acids and spicy in the finish. If this is your style, enjoy.",84,18,California,Lodi,Viognier
US,"Tastes hot and enormously high in alcohol, with simple, sweet Porty flavors that are overripe, and veer into raisins and prunes.",82,34,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
US,"Tastes hot and prickly in alcohol, which puts everything else off, including the black cherry, bacon, olive and herb flavors, which are actually pretty good. Drink now.",86,32,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Franc
US,"Tastes its best now, with jammy blackberry, cherry and raspberry flavors, and a rich overlay of oak. The tannins and acids are soft and gentle.",86,49,California,Sonoma Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tastes jammy sweet and bubble gummy, with the gassiness of a Beaujolais Nouveau. It's more full-bodied than that, of course, with black cherry flavors.",83,8,California,California,Merlot
US,"Tastes jammy sweet and oaky, with vanilla and caramel flavors framing pineapples and peaches. Gets the Chardonnay job done at a basic level.",84,14,California,California,Chardonnay
US,"Tastes like a cross between a flowery, fruity Pinot Gris and a ripe, oaky Sauvignon Blanc. The flavors are enormously rich, spanning the gamut from pears and tangerines to green melons, white peaches, pineapples and honeysuckles. Best in its youthful exuberance.",88,30,California,Lake County,Roussanne
US,"Tastes like a dessert pastry, with baked cherry, cassis, peppermint, milk chocolate and anise flavors that are a little sweet and honeyed. Pleasant, but not impactful. Drink now.",84,42,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Merlot
US,"Tastes like a rustic Zinfandel, with spicy, briary flavors of cherries, blackberries, currants and dark chocolate. The tannins are somewhat green and angular.",85,35,California,Carneros,Primitivo
US,"Tastes like a sugary peach, pear, mango and orange juice fruit drink you buy at the supermarket. Make it drier, and it would be a terrific Viognier.",83,22,California,Santa Barbara County,Viognier
US,"Tastes like a supermarket peach, mango and pineapple fruit-juice drink, with the headiness of alcohol. There's a subtle hint of oak in this wine that finishes on the sweet side.",84,19,California,Paso Robles,Grenache Blanc
US,"Tastes like a white Rh√¥ne blend, with tangerine, white peach, nectarine and mineral flavors, but surprise, it's Chardonnay. Crisp acidity provides balance, and the finish is clean and elegant. Great price for a full-bodied white wine this rich.",88,12,California,Central Coast,Chardonnay
US,"Tastes like an old wine that Nonno brought up from the basement in a carafe. It's supposedly a Bordeaux blend, but it could be anything red and full-bodied.",82,30,California,Paso Robles,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Tastes like Chardonnay with bubbles and yeast. With a slightly sweet finish, this bubbly has flavors of limes, green apples and lees.",84,12,California,California,Chardonnay

US,"Tastes like orange juice with an extra hit of white sugar, sprinkled with cinnamon, vanilla and an oaky sweetness.",82,17,California,Sonoma County,Chardonnay
US,"Tastes like sugared orange and apricot juice, with a bizarre hit of acidity. Lacks dryness and breed, especially at this price.",82,25,California,Santa Barbara County,Roussanne
US,"Tastes like the wine equivalent of a dessert pastry. It's soft and sugary sweet, with raspberry and cherry pie filling, white chocolate and vanilla flavors. High alcohol gives it a peppery heat.",84,24,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
US,"Tastes like the wine equivalent of blackberry and cherry jam. It's extracted, ripe and fruity, with a hit of citrusy acidity. Oak adds the usual notes of sweet buttered toast. Lots of people will like it at this price.",84,20,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Merlot
US,"Tastes like toothpicks, with buttered toast, butterscotch and vanilla flavors dominating everything else. Somewhere underneath is some tangerine and mango fruit.",83,40,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"Tastes more like a Zin than a Cab, with rustic tannins and a peppery, briary flavor of wild berries. The wine is dry, but way too soft for any development, so drink now.",84,38,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tastes off-dry to sweet, with sugary flavors of apricots, peaches, pears, honeysuckle flowers and vanilla, with a touch of smoky oak. Crisp acidity helps provide balance.",84,29,California,Paso Robles,Roussanne

US,"Tastes old and tired, losing fruit and turning herbal, nutty and earthy, with dried apricot and orange flavors. Interesting from a connoisseur's point of view, but it's hard to tell why Mayacamas held back this wine for so long.",85,30,California,Mount Veeder,Chardonnay
US,"Tastes sweet and alcoholic, with vegetal flavors that barely break into berries and cocoa.",80,13,California,Lodi,Zinfandel

US,"Tastes unnatural and manipulated, with sugary sweet orange and apricot jam fruit flavors, highlighted by uncomfortably sour acidity.",82,26,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Tastes unusually lush and soft for a Napa Cab. While it's officially dry, sweet, caramelized oak and raspberry-jam flavors, along with a slick, glycerine mouthfeel, makes it as rich as a candy bar.",86,70,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tastes vegetal and tired. The wine is losing its pineapple and pear fruit, and there's not much to replace it except alcohol and oak.",83,40,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Tastes way too oaky, with a plaster of sweet vanilla and caramelized charcoal. The underlying pineapple fruit just isn't strong enough to support all that wood.",82,19,California,Monterey,Chardonnay
US,"Tastes young, sharp in acids and jammy sweet right now, with upfront cherry, raspberry and blackberry flavors. But after all, it is a California Barbera, and these puppies age forever. Give it some time, but don't expect it ever to become sophisticated.",85,35,California,Sierra Foothills,Barbera
US,"Tasting of lemonade, this Lodi Chardonnay veers sour in uneven layers, finishing in toasty vanilla oak. A perfect wine for casual get togethers.",84,13,California,Lodi,Chardonnay

Delicious, lingering flavors of tangerine, pink grapefruit and orange peel combine in a wine with a sensational yum factor.",94,28,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling
US,"Tempranillo has become a mainstay red grape in southern Oregon, but it's a rarity further north. Light toasty fruit flavors suggest tart raspberry with a hint of wood from 14 months in 20% new American oak barrels.

US,"Terlato has mastered the art of crafting Bordeaux-style red wines that scream Napa Valley. The style is the modern one of exceptional ripeness, softness and sweetness, generously oaked and slightly high in alcohol.

It's ready to drink now, and should develop in the bottle for at least 10 more years.",94,175,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Terrific structure on this well made wine. You'll be impressed by the rich tannins and fine acids. Caresses the palate with gentle smoothness. But be forewarned, this wine is lean on fruit. It's herbal and earthy. But it shows that a Napa red doesn't have to be fruit bomb to be elegant and delicious.",89,52,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
US,"Testarossa's single-vineyard expertise shines on this wine from Rosella's, which is fresh and alive on the nose with ripe nectarine and grapefruit peel. The acidity carries prominently on the palate, but the ruby-red grapefruit elements are not sharp, possessing both sweet and savory sides and finishing with some bitterness. Serve with honey-glazed seared scallops.",92,45,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
US,"Textbook Howell Mountain Cabernet, classic in the volume of its tannins and the intensity of its fruit.

US,"Textbook Russian River Zin, this is a big, powerful, lusty wine, with a briary, brambly profile. It's enormously complex in flavor, offering notes of fresh summer berry, cola, licorice, dark chocolate and leather that are delicious and savory.

US,"Textural and leesy, this refreshing Chardonnay also has a pretty, toasty nose. The mouthfeel and barrel notes compensate for the rather light, generic fruit.",87,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
US,"Textured and lengthy, this full-bodied reserve-level wine is soft and round on the palate, expressive in black olive, black cherry, mocha and vanilla. It offers impressive richness and leathery grit on the palate.",91,125,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Textured and medium bodied, this wine has a simplicity of citrus and peachy stone fruit buoyed by bright acidity. Fermented entirely in stainless steel, it was aged in concrete, stainless steel and French oak. It displays the concentration of the vintage.",88,25,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Textured vanilla-cream and green apple appear initially in this wine, which offers plenty of weight and structure around a core of balanced acidity and fresh lemon zest. Cardamom and vanilla play at the edges alongside elements of savory brine and white flowers. The oak presence is subtle.",92,58,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay

US,"That terrific Santa Rita acidity is there, and the oak regimen tastes very expensive, but the fruit doesn't seem up to the task. It's a pretty good wine, with pineapples, dates, cr√®me br√ªl√©e and spices, but there should be greater richness and complexity from this esteemed vineyard.",86,39,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"That this small-lot Lodi producer has ventured out to the Russian River Valley for Zinfandel says something here and it says it with finesse, this being austere for Zin, not jammy, with enviable structure and a nice lift of black cherry, spicy cola and earth at the end.",90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
US,"The 10% Cabernet Sauvignon in the blend adds extra muscle to this toasty, sleek wine. It's light but polished, with pretty scents and flavors of rose water and raspberries. The generous acidity of the grape keeps it lively and fresh.",88,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sangiovese

US,"The 12 Hanging Delta Vineyard is a plusher, more decadent expression of grapefruit, mandarin orange and stone fruit flavors common to all of Fox Run's 2012 geology series. It's lip-smacking with sweetness and exceptionally light in body yet maintains an elegant, vibrant style. The finish is tinged by an earthier touch of smoked nuts and slate.",89,30,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
US,"The 14 Hands Cabernet has more grip and authority than the Hot To Trot Red, but perhaps less immediate appeal. Black cherry and fig fruit are swathed in chocolate malt flavors, with a wash of mocha setting up the finish. Take your pick; either of these reds is sure to please.",87,12,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The 14 Hands Cabernet is more tightly wound than its companion Merlot, but the flavors follow the same winning formula, with a heavy emphasis on coffee cream and cherry tobacco. A generous streak of kahlua runs down the spine.",87,12,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The 16% by volume alcohol on this Zin is high even by Wilson's standards. It gives the wine a burn that it does not wear well. The body and flavors aren't rich enough to carry the heat, the way that a proper Port can. Richly-sauced barbecue is your best bet for food pairing.",84,36,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
US,"The 2004 was soft and immediately enjoyable. This '05 is tannic and better structured and needs some time. It displays a wealth of black cherry and currant flavors. Hold if you can until after 2008, and should develop well for an additional 4 years.",91,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The 2005 and 2006 bottlings of this Cabernet were awesome. So is this 2007. At the age of more than six years, it's just beginning its long journey. It's still tannic, but with ripe, sweet tannins that frame gorgeous, deeply satisfying blueberry, black currant, mocha and cedar flavors. It drinks well now, and will develop further in the bottle over the next eight years.",93,86,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The 2005 continues along the established path of this rising star winery. It's big, no holds barred, rich and jammy, and just a bit warm at 14.8% alcohol. The fruit is nicely woven together, brambly and dark, and coated with clean barrel flavors of coffee and chocolate. Everything is balanced and forward, but you get the sense that this wine is holding something back for the future.",91,36,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"The 2007 vintage was a fabulous one for Williams Selyem, and the Zinfandels benefited from the cool, balanced growing season. The Papera is a big, rich, jammy wine, but also a drily elegant one. It offers waves of raspberry, Fig Newton, red currant and Canadian bacon flavors, with superfine tannins. An exuberant Zinfandel now and for the next six years.",94,48,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
US,"The 2008 vintage in California was the last really hot one before the recent series of cooler years, and this Cabernet tastes like it developed raisin and prune juice flavors in the heat. It's tasty in its own way, like a chocolate and roasted almond granola bar, but it isn't ageable.",84,50,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The 2009 vintage was a great one for this bottling, which was too sweet in 2008. This one's more like the '05, only richer and better. It feels nice and crisp and dry, with polished, complex citrus fruit, white flower, peach and mineral flavors.",91,22,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The 2010 Widowmaker shows a bit more fruit, less funk than usual. It's a pleasing mix of berries, cherries, plums and figs, along with clean earth, green tea and a hint of chocolate. The tannins are smooth and the flavors linger gracefully and slowly fade through the finish.",93,85,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The 2011 and 2012 Chardonnays from DaMa are a study in contrasts, showing how very different the vintages were. Both come from Sagemoor and Conner Lee grapes, but in 2012 the wine has more floral highlights, and a vertical crispness to its structure. Flavors of anise, green apple and pear are wound up in the tight frame, and this would appear to have some years of life ahead.",91,21,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
US,"The 2012 reserve costs only $3 more than the regular bottling, but it's a richer wine balanced with bright, citrusy acidity. The palate is dry with flavors of Bosc pears, green apples, vanilla cream and toasted marshmallows.",89,19,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The 80% new oak on this wine really sticks out, giving toasty, caramelized and vanilla bean notes. That makes the underlying cherry, blackberry and raspberry fruit, which is superripe, taste jammy, almost sweet. The result is a little in your face, but it's quite a rich wine that might develop some bottle nuance over the next 4‚Äì6 years.",88,60,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The ‚ÄúEssence‚Äù in the designation refers to the wine's sources, which are selected blocks from the winery's vineyards in the southern part of Napa. The wine is absolutely dry, mouthwatering in acidity, and vastly complex. There's a touch of smoky, vanilla-scented French oak, but the fruit flavors star. They suggest stone-driven minerals, Meyer lemons, limes, white peaches, pink grapefruits and a savory, umami-rich note of figs. The wine is ideal now and should evolve for many years.",95,50,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The ‚ÄúX‚Äù designation refers to the number of clones in this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon. You have to search for the richness‚Äîburied so deeply now‚Äîbut it's there, like a pirate treasure of blackberries, black currants and cassis liqueur. Hard, thick and resistant now, it's framed by astringent tannins and a dryness that's almost arid. Charles Krug clearly built this wine to age, and there's no reason it shouldn't. Your window begins in 2018 and should last a very long time.",94,100,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The acidity is the prominent attribute of this wine, jutting out with little flesh to buffer its cut. Light, dusty tannins add some traction to the palate, with a leafy herb note surfacing on the short finish.",83,36,Massachusetts,Southeastern New England,Cabernet Franc
US,"The acidity on this fine wine makes your mouth water, giving a clean bite to the pineapple, orange, sweet cream, honeysuckle and cinnamon-spice flavors. The balance of tartness and sweetness is what makes the wine so appealing.",88,20,California,Santa Barbara County,Pinot Gris

US,"The addition of 15% Petite Sirah takes this bottling to a compelling place, showing barely ripe blackberries, animal fat, smoke, black pepper and a wild clove element on the nose. It's rich and layered on the palate, where chalky tannins support black cherry, grilled beef and mint flavors. This has the bones to last awhile.",91,28,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Franc

US,"The addition of 20% Roussanne to the blend seems to thicken the palate‚Äîwhich is not a bad thing at all. A scent of honeysuckle piles on top of the flavors of honey, chamomile tea, lemon, orange and pink grapefruit, creating a luscious wine with impressive length.",90,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier
US,"The addition of 5% S√©millon proves to be the right call in this white, a structured, spritzy glass of tree-ripened apricot and exotic lemongrass with a pleasant heft to the palate. A twist of ripeness gives a mouthwatering, juicy finish.",90,40,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The addition of 9% Traminette lends a blossomy flair to fresh apple and tangerine notes in this bright, unoaked Chardonnay. Brisk and revitalizing, with a zesty lime-toned acidity, it's a satisfying late-summer quaffer at a bargain price.",89,11,New York,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay

US,"The alcohol is high, giving the wine a peppery burn, but it's fun and delicious and utterly unique, in its own high mountain way. Completely dry, the flavors are of blackberries cooked into a pie and black pepper, with just a hint of raisins.",90,29,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
US,"The alcohol is pretty high, but the wine is decadently rich and forward in pie-filling flavors of cherries, raspberries, currants and chocolate, seasoned with anise, cinnamon and pepper. Firm tannins give much-needed structure to this deliciously dry Cab Franc.",90,55,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Franc
US,"The alcohol is refreshingly low on this wine, making it delicate in the mouth. It's also full of lemon, peach and vanilla flavors. Easy to drink with hors d'oeuvres.",85,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The alcohol level of nearly 16% is the star, or the villain, of the show. It gives this Zin a hot, peppery mouthfeel, not to mention going to your head. On the other hand, the wine is dry and richly flavored in wild berries and spices, and the tannic quality is very fine.",84,40,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
US,"The alcohol on this Cabernet is fairly high, yet the wine tastes and feels dry, supple and balanced in the mouth, with tannins so smooth, they're drinkable now.

This is certainly an ageable wine that will reward your patience through 2020 or so.",92,75,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The Amador Zin specialist is offering its first ever Grenache here, a tremendous debut, super light in color and texture, lightly rendered to show off its layers of delicate violet and raspberry amid a meatier backbone of lurking anise and herbs. With 9% Mourvedre and 5% Syrah, this is a light red worth seeking out.",89,20,California,Shenandoah Valley (CA),Grenache
US,"The appellation famous for Pinot Noir and Chardonnay packs a powerfully pretty punch when it comes to this variety, too, showing in this wine a soft, focused layering of Luxardo maraschino cherry and touch of cranberry. It then reveals an underlying richness that rewards the patient with a splash of white and black pepper, leaving an indelible stamp on the palate. Drink now through 2024.",95,47,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
US,"The appellation is showcased in all its glory in this 100% varietal wine, a brooding and weighty experience with a ton of power and concentration.

US,"The aroma of charred oak dominates this Malbec, while oak tannins rule the palate. The underyling wine is soft and fruity and tannic in itself, with blackberry and currant flavors.

US,"The aroma of this sleek and polished wine has hints of flowers and dark chocolate, while flavors suggest Bing cherries dusted with cocoa. Most impressive is the texture that is firm and refreshing, but also luxurious. While very flavorful and concentrated, it's not to heavy or too tannic.",92,32,California,Lake County,Cabernet Franc

US,"The Black Sears Vineyard has been source to some of Napa's most impressive Zinfandels over the years, for a number of wineries, including Sattui. With this 2011, they've outdone themselves.

Yes, the alcohol is on the high side, but that's the price of such richness.",92,42,California,Howell Mountain,Zinfandel

Full and even on the tongue, this black beauty finishes with lingering spice and espresso notes.",88,24,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
US,"The blend here is 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Syrah, all from the Crawford vineyard.

A whiff of bourbon barrel sets up the sharp finish.",86,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"The blend includes 2% Muscat, an experiment that may not be repeated, though it worked quite well, boosting the aromatics and adding pretty floral notes at the top. The fruit is solidly anchored in citrus, pear and peach; and the barrels add a pleasing toastiness to the finish. There's a hint of anise as well. Lovely balance and fullness throughout.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
US,"The blend includes 22% Cabernet Sauvignon, and was aged in 22% new (mostly French) oak. A streak of caraway and pepper suggests less than optimal ripening, though the fruit reaches tart black cherry concentration. Tannins are a bit astringent.",87,32,Washington,Washington,Cabernet Franc
US,"The blend includes 4% each Cabernet Franc and Merlot. It was aged in 80% new oak, but retains its lovely, sweetly floral nose and luscious, berry fruit flavors. Yes, there is plenty of toasty oak goodness, but it's layered in with the fruit and soil flavors. Overall, this is a thoroughly enjoyable bottle right now, with a good decade or more of aging potential.",93,35,Oregon,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The blend includes 6% Pinot Gris. This is a crisp, well-crafted bottle of wine, with more flesh and fruit than the Pine & Post Chardonnay from Precept Brands. Melon, pear, and orange fruit is accented with a little honey; this is a big step forward for this brand.",88,7,Washington,Washington,Chardonnay
US,"The blend includes 6% Syrah, and the wine has a pretty plum and blueberry color, that (perhaps by the power of suggestion) carries through into the aromas. It's tight, tart, and clean, offering a mix of berry fruits and a finish lined with vanilla and tobacco. Overall the balance is excellent, the wine juicy and fresh, and the blend just about perfect.",87,8,Washington,Washington,Merlot
US,"The blend includes a bit of Merlot and Cabernet Franc (10% each). Weinbau and Sagemoor fruit make for a soft, instantly enjoyable red with smooth, supple flavors. Mixed red fruits, light spices and soft tannins lead through and into a gentle finish with a hint of dark chocolate.",89,35,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The blend is 50% Merlot, 33% Cabernet Sauvignon and 17% Cabernet Franc, aged in 100% new French oak. The only wine from this producer that is a blend, it currently shows an abundance of barrel flavors. The baking spices overpower some of the signature elements that this distinguished vineyard imparts‚Äîthe mineral, saline, iron and steel notes often found in Ciel's red wines. The fruit remains gorgeously ripe, and with a bit more bottle age those subtle flavors may reappear.",91,60,Washington,Red Mountain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"The blend is 85% Viognier and 15% Roussanne, and finishes off-dry with 1.5% residual sugar. A slight blush color and mixed fruit flavors of melon and pear carry the wine, which has a definite sugary sweetness in the mouth. There is also an impression of celery, believe it or not, making for an unusual mix that will intrigue some tasters, and confuse others.",87,23,Washington,Yakima Valley,Viognier
US,"The blend is classic Bordeaux‚Äî85% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Merlot, 5% Cabernet Franc and 3% Malbec. It's got grip and a sensuous mix of wild herb, black olive and mountain berry. There is plenty of acid to support it, and winemaker J-F Pellet has been pulling back on the new oak, so that newer releases of Pepper Bridge are more structured and tilting more toward a European sensibility, which is to say, ageworthy.",92,50,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The bottle states upfront that the wine is barrel fermented and aged though it's easy to figure out by the aromas of vanilla, sawdust and singed popcorn that define the nose. Some pineapple and malted milk tones peek through on the palate but the fruit is thoroughly trumped by the oak on the finish. Drink up.",85,20,New York,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay
US,"The bouquet is a bit flat at first, offering nothing more than white stone fruits and pear. Green melon is amplified by a dose of white pepper on the palate, while the finish is layered and solid; it's the best part of the wine by far.",87,25,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The brambly wild berry flavors have an exotic edge of white pepper and Chinese five-spice that's interesting and even complex. But the wine is utterly lacking in acidity, which makes it syrupy even though it's totally dry.",81,35,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel
US,"The Branding Iron Vineyard is located in western Oakville, in the company of some of the greatest names in Napa Valley. The wine is 100% varietal, aged in new and one-year-old oak. In the mouth, it's plush and opulent, with massive blackberry and blueberry fruit, but very tannic, in the Nickel & Nickel style. This is a wine that needs cellaring. Best after 2018, and should be singing by 2020.",93,100,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"The Cabernet is the best of the Girly Girl wines. This herbal, honest and no-frills Cabernet would be perfectly fine served alongside a grilled flank steak.",87,17,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The caramel oakiness of this wine is offset by austere structure and a focused midpalate, the flavors leaning toward cool-climate green apple and kumquat. It returns to richness and intensity on the finish.",86,34,California,Oak Knoll District,Chardonnay
US,"The cassis, black currant, chocolate and sweet oak flavors star in this soft, easy wine. It could use a firmer structure, but it's very savory and easy to drink.",85,25,California,Lodi,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The cedar, cherry and mocha aromas and flavors are light and there's not a lot of structure to this silky soft wine, but it still flies straight down the fairway and brings much to enjoy.",87,15,Idaho,,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The Celilo vineyard, located on the Washington side of the Columbia Gorge appellation, is one of the most unique in the region. This ripe, almost liquorous Merlot is bursting with sappy cherry fruit, buttressed with tangy acids. The structure is here to more than support the weight of the wine and its alcohol, just under 15%. Barrel flavors of bourbon and vanilla dominate the finish.",88,24,Oregon,Columbia Gorge (OR),Merlot
US,"The charms of this full-bodied wine are mainly in the substantial and viscous texture, while mild mineral and apricot flavors provide subtle backup. Far from being simply fruity, the style emphaizes the soothing, mouth-coating feel of the wine.",87,13,California,Clarksburg,Chenin Blanc

Charred fruit flavor is also prominent on the palate, where bright acidity and sticky tannins make for a simultaneously rich and sour experience.",86,17,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The chef returns to wine in this blend of mostly Chardonnay with 4% Viognier. A smooth, round and ripely agreeable quaff, it's thick in oak with a taste of vanilla.",87,20,California,Sonoma County,Chardonnay
US,"The Claret is half Cabernet Sauvignon, with the other four Bordeaux grapes filling in the other half, and is quite firm, sappy and muscular. It is tightly structured with cassis, black cherry and plenty of dark, tarry undertones. The herbal aspects show in some black olive and black tea flavors; the tannins are strong and supple, and the wine has a sinuous finish suggesting both strength and length. An exceptional value, this wine should age very nicely.",91,30,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"The clean, brisk mouthfeel gives this slightly oaked Sauvignon Blanc instant likeability. It's dry with a rich streak of honey that sweetens the citrus, pear and tropical fruit flavors. Pair this with Asian fare, ham or a green salad with grapefruit sections.",86,14,California,Paso Robles,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The clonal selection related to the regional pioneer is the most interesting thing about this bottling, which is incredibly light and delicate, so much so that there is not tons of flavor. The nose shows very faint apple skins and key lime, and the palate barely offers pear skins and slate, though there is an intriguing texture.",86,35,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Viognier
US,"The color is light, which is natural for the variety, while aromas are lightly fruity, earthy and tobacco-like. Bright raspberry and cranberry flavors come with cedar and dried-herb accents that add complexity.

US,"The combination of a cool growing region and a cool vintage have made this wine very tart, with low alcohol. Don't look for fat, opulent tropical fruits here. Instead, you'll find lemons, limes and mangoes, complex and mouthwatering.",88,21,California,San Luis Obispo County,Chardonnay
US,"The combination of very high alcohol and what tastes like residual sugar gives this Grenache an excessively sweet, glyceriney taste. It's fabulously rich in raspberry cream, blackberry jam, mocha, vanilla and cinnamon spice flavors. Very flamboyant and delicious, but really more of a dessert wine than a dry table wine.",91,48,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Grenache
US,"The complex nose boasts hints of spring flowers, tobacco, maple syrup and cedar. Now into its second decade, this wine is fully mature, with flavors of molasses and mushrooms that have replaced some of the cherry notes of its youth. The mouthfeel is silky and elegant; the finish chocolaty and smooth. Drink up.",90,85,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The complex, seductive nose promises a bit more than the palate delivers. Nonetheless, there is good complexity and a moderately long, if somewhat watery, finish. The slight residual sugar will make this a good choice with drier Asian dishes. Drink now.",87,12,New York,Cayuga Lake,Riesling
US,"The cool vintage has kept this wine tart in acidity; and there may even be a touch of botrytis, to judge from the golden apricot note that rides over the pears, limes and buttery cream. Bone dry and minerally, it's an elegant, Chablis-style wine for drinking now.",91,30,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The cool vintage was a challenge, which speaks well of the winery's vineyard team. Blended with 5% Petite Sirah, the wine is unusually complex and sumptuous, even by Dry Creek standards. The flavors are rich with wild summer blueberries and blackberries, and savory with pepper and other exotic spices.",93,38,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
US,"The coolness of the region and vintage shows in this Chard's acidic crispness and minerality. It comes down on the Chablis-style end of the spectrum, with hints of tropical fruits, apples and pears, as well as a welcome touch of sweet oak. Easily Silverado's best Chardonnay in years.",90,25,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"The core aromas of blackberry and dark cherry are detailed with touches of catnip, black tea and mocha. Medium in body, this wine has bright acidity and fine, chalky tannins that add grip to the succulent dark-berry flavor. The elegant 12.6% alcohol makes this wine extra food friendly.",88,24,Virginia,Virginia,Cabernet Franc
US,"The cranberry and dark raspberry notes dance alongside bittersweet chocolate and spice on this directly appealing, outright delicious wine. It's broad in feel, with rich chocolate and cherry flavors that keep you coming back for more.",91,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sangiovese
US,"The current downturn in demand for both grapes and expensive wines only helps A to Z; there is more good fruit to purchase, and plenty of demand at a $12 price point. This new Pinot Gris is fresh and racy, with a mineral-driven acidity underlying the clean fruit, tasting of pears and pear skin.",88,12,Oregon,Oregon,Pinot Gris
US,"The curve on this wine has been going up and up, and this '09 is their best yet. It's bone dry and savory in acids, with ultraclean citrus, mineral and white flower flavors. Just delicious as a cocktail sipper.",87,10,California,Lake County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The Damaris Chardonnay has varied in grape sourcing over the years, ranging from Santa Maria Valley to Sonoma Valley. But with this new Sonoma Coast bottling, the wine has hit new heights.

US,"The Daou brothers aren't known for subtlety, so it's no surprise that this Sauvignon Blanc is rich and plush with oak-kissed peach, smoked apple and toasted nut aromas. There's good energy and grip to the palate, with tangy Meyer lemon rind flavor and that powerful oak smoke that's uncommon for Central Coast whites but befits the house style.",90,50,California,Adelaida District,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The debut vintage for this cuv√©e, this is made from 100% Wente clone vines planted in 1977. It's richly concented on the palate, layered with dried apricot, grapefruit and pineapple flavors. A lush, buttery note enwraps its long, satisfying, full-bodied finish.",94,95,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Chardonnay
US,"The deep color of this wine prefigures its dark aromas, which are redolent of black mission fig cake, chocolate and cigar box. The medium-full palate feels expansive, and it's structured with fine, mouth-coating tannins that carry onto the textured finish.",87,19,Virginia,Shenandoah Valley,Cabernet Franc
US,"The deep gold color of this relatively young wine suggests that oxidation is setting in. But wait! This wine explodes into full glory 24 hours after first being opened. It begins with intense aromas and flavors of dried apricots, apples and a hint of ginger, showing impressive length on the finish. It turns into a breathtaking, sp√§tlese-style effort on the palate, with honey, Meyer lemon and ripe grapefruit flavors.",94,22,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling
US,"The deep gold-brown color hints that this will be something unusual. Made in an overtly oaky style, this smells toasty and buttery and tastes like that too. Some will love it but more fruit flavor would balance out the apparently heavy winemaking inputs.",85,22,California,Livermore Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The deep orange-gold color makes this wine look like a late-harvest version, and fragrant floral and apricot aromas continue that impression. But the wine is dry, light-bodied, somewhat tannic and chewy in texture and nutty in flavor. It fits the distinctive Donkey & Goat style of skin-contact, non-intervention winemaking.",87,32,California,El Dorado,Roussanne
US,"The delicate nose on this reserve Chard offers citrus and flowers with a touch of nutty spice. On the palate, it's a straightforward white with elements of lemon citrus, grapefruit and hazelnut. An easy-drinking Chardonnay with class.",86,20,New York,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay

US,"The dense aromas of raisin, panettone and dark cherry are of medium intensity. Medium to full-bodied, the palate is soft and malleable, and it ends with flavors of cherry cola and dark raspberry.",84,15,Virginia,Virginia,Cabernet Franc
US,"The distinctive nose on this bottling is tight yet tropical, with mango, pineapple, pear skins, orange rinds, dried lime peels and a gin-like juniper all converging. The palate offers a balance between tightly woven texture and ripe tropicality, with lime rinds, mango and petrol touches.",87,25,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Grenache Blanc
US,"The dominant dark-cherry aroma smells bitter and high pitched. The palate feels supple and medium bodied, and it tastes a touch confected, like blackberry jelly used to fill donuts.",82,25,Virginia,Virginia,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The dryness and earthiness of this Merlot are just fine. It suggests flavors of herbs, tobacco and leather, in addition to cherries. But it's a bit too coarse and unstructured to get a higher score.",84,28,California,Marin County,Merlot
US,"The dryness and low alcohol are praiseworthy, but more challenging are hard tannins and biting acidity. With blackberry and sweet green-herb flavors, it's the opposite of today's ripe cult style, but by no means unattractive.",86,25,California,Paicines,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The dryness and minerality of this wine, combined with its clean, brisk elegance, make it a very nice partner for shellfish. The flavors are lemons, limes, and ripe, crisp white peaches.",89,15,California,Sonoma County,Chardonnay
US,"The earthy aromas of this medium-bodied wine will not be to everyone's liking, but it follows up with very ripe fruit flavors and a smooth texture.",83,13,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The entry-level offering for Rajat Parr's luxury brand, this is barely noticeable on the nose, with mere hints of melon. On the palate, it's pleasantly Chardonnay-like but quite naked and flat in flavor.",85,38,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"The entry-level Zin from Angel Vine combines fruit from the three single vineyard cuv√©es, along with a splash of Petite Sirah. Rich, plush berry scents and grapey berry fruit flavors abound‚Äîboysenberry, blackberry and more, buoyed with natural acidity. There is no sense that the alcohol is intrusive, and the wine fades gently with hints of red licorice and cocoa.",90,19,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Zinfandel
US,"The estate vineyard is in Calistoga, and the wine shows gorgeously ripe flavors but never loses its basic Napa elegance and balance. Filled with flamboyant blackberry jam, cherry, cassis, licorice, chocolate and smoky vanilla-oak flavors, it appeals immediately to the tastebuds, but has the tannin-acid balance to age for a decade.",90,65,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The estate-grown grapes for this wine come from some of the appellation's highest-elevation sites, at the base of Mount Veeder. Natural acidity is the star of the show, a nice surprise after a decadent honeyed color and bouquet. Serious texture and complexity give way to a touch of salted caramel and peach.",93,35,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"The excellent Carabella vineyard supplies the fruit, which is fermented and aged in a mix of stainless and oak barrels. Juicy and tight, this offers melon, lemon, apple and pear, framed with citrus-rind phenolics. A little bite to the finish suggests that another year or two in bottle might help to soften it.",89,28,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The excellent Les Collines Vineyard usually delivers more depth of flavor than this, but a cool vintage may be the culprit. Very light berry flavors, a wash of cement-like mineral and earthy tannins with an herbal edge sum up the flavor profile.",86,32,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The excellent Olsen vineyards provided the fruit for this pure Malbec. It's still quite young, showing clean and tightly-wound flavors. Berry and cherry fruit highlights the palate, with a light hint of chocolate woven through the finish.",88,39,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Malbec
US,"The expected aromas of cut grass and cat pee get a bit of support from peach and herb accents. On the palate are flavors of green apple, oregano, lemon, dill and bell pepper. This is light and refreshing.",87,15,California,Edna Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The extra time has helped to unwrap what must have been an exceedingly compact wine, but it still needs to be decanted and/or cellared further. The black fruits are subservient to the dense, tarry tannins. Everything is ripe, but ripe as fine Bordeaux is ripe, with earth and bark and herb still prominent.",91,50,Washington,Yakima Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"The faintest waft of marshmallow lends a pleasantly confectionery note to stone-fruit and blossom aromas on this dry, medium-bodied Riesling. The palate is elegant with brisk herbal tones and zesty lime acidity.",87,18,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
US,"The family-owned, Santa Lucia Highlands-focused Wrath Winery produces their Ex Anima line to show off wines from their estate San Saba Vineyard made with very little intervention and no new oak. This wine is nearly as clear as water, and yet offers aromas or freshly cut grass, honeydew melon, kiwi and fresh rain on rocks. On the palate, minerality lingers alongside poached pear and peach. Refreshing and light, yet full of flavor.",90,19,California,Monterey,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The famous growers branch out into their own wines with aplomb in this 100% varietal wine, tangoing with a much sought-after grape from their property. Sanguine and gamy, it's structured in good acidity and low oak, showing a succulence of blackberry.",91,48,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
US,"The fantastic nose pitches French toast together with Meyer lemon pith, crushed rock, struck match and a slight sour-cream element. This wine is immediately lively on the tongue, with lots of but not overdone acidity. Yeasty toast flavors are cut by lemon and poached pear on a racy and focused palate.",93,48,California,Sta.

Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"The fault with this enormous Zin is that despite a hefty 15.6% alcohol, it still tastes as sweet as a ruby Port. Fifty percent new oak only contributes caramel to what should properly be labeled a dessert wine.",82,39,California,Howell Mountain,Zinfandel
US,"The finest Gamache Cabernet Franc since the 2008, this is arguably the best value in the winery's entire lineup. There's excellent varietal character on display, a mix of blueberries and coffee grounds, and the overall balance is improved by virtue of the cooler 2011 vintage, keeping alcohol levels in check.",91,27,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Franc
US,"The first Merlot offering from this producer, this is 100% varietal and totally full-throttle in its fleshy components of vanilla and chocolate, seasoned in cinnamon.

US,"The first offering from Domaine Drouhin Oregon's newly-minted vineyard, RoseRock. It's a young, fresh, fruity wine, loaded with flavors of apple, pineapple and light tropical fruits. There's a light pat of butter in the finish. Drink over the next couple of years while the freshness is at its best.",90,35,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Chardonnay
US,"The first release for Tranche from Blue Mountain (estate) fruit, this classic Cabernet benefits from the same extended aging in barrel and bottle that sister winery Corliss gives its wines. Toasty, smoky and precisely defined dark fruit hold down the core, a muscular mix of black cherry, cassis, dried herb and leaf. Firm and compact, with well-integrated barrel flavors (two thirds were new), this balances Euro elegance with New World vitality.",92,40,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The first release on the winery's new label program, which shines a bright light on the soils of their sprawling vineyard atop the Cuesta Grade, this offers clean aromas of lemon peel. The palate is almost spritzy with energy, showing lime juice, green pear and dried-apple flavors all bound together by a searing acidity.",87,15,California,Paso Robles,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The first such bottling from the producer's 75-acre ranch on Westside Road, this impressive white is crisp in acidity with a fullness of body, both lengthy and complex. Apple skin, nutmeg, Bosc pear and a salty lilt combine effortlessly around a core of power and concentration that continues to evolve in the glass.",94,65,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The first whiff brings a noseful of sulfur, although most of it blows off on airing. The underlying flavors are lovely, though, suggesting citrus fruits and apple, supported by crisp acidity. Finishes clean and crisp. Would score higher except for the opening smell.",83,14,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"The first white wine from this winery, there's a lot of intrigue here: notes of mandarin orange, lime, and dried herbs. It's medium bodied and drinks just a hair off-dry, with tart fruit flavors.",87,17,Idaho,,Riesling
US,"The first Zin reviewed from Naggiar, this is a beauty. Power and grace combine in this concentrated and well-structured wine. It smells and tastes like black cherries and blackberries with hints of cocoa and black pepper. The velvety texture delivers smoothness with a nice grip from tannins, and conveys a wonderful sense of depth.",91,22,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
US,"The first-ever varietal Malbec for Barrister, this captures the vivid core of tart, delicious, juicy and deep raspberry fruit, elevated further with lemony acidity. The wine is penetrating, tart and quite young, but lip-smackingly tasty.",90,28,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Malbec
US,"The flagship wine from Quilceda Creek offers exotic scents of plum, cassis, loam, coffee and pine sap, a rich and evocative blend. The wine delivers all that is promised and more; it is deep and dense with flavor, polished, focused and persistent. Vanilla, espresso, fine tannins, luscious acids and cascading fruits.",99,125,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The Flash Point is a new name for the familiar Trio Reserve, which uses grapes that are sourced entirely from the Boushey Vineyard. Here the toasty oak barrel flavors dominate, while the fruit tends toward a light strawberry flavor, with more mocha than grape flavor.",88,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Sangiovese
US,"The flavors in this Zin are very lush and delicious, suggesting a m√©lange of crushed wild forest berries, freshly ground black peppercorn, mocha, anise and something animal, like sweet, soy-splashed grilled beef. The drawback is excessive softness, which may be related to high alcohol. The correct tannic structure isn't there.",85,34,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
US,"The flavors of this medium-bodied wine are hearty, with bell pepper, black pepper and green olive notes, and in this vein it's tasty and fairly concentrated. The balance is good, the palate sensation is nicely dry and the finish lingers a bit.",87,10,California,Lodi,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"The fruit here is plenty ripe, with flavors of raspberry jam. Tannins are also substantial, and the scents and flavors leave an impression of slightly burnt coffee, underscored with graphite. This definitely needs decanting and/or aggressive aeration.",88,30,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Cabernet Franc
US,"The fruit is forward and tart, mixing berries, cherries and plums; and the tannins almost disappear in a pillowy cloud.

Tannins frame the heavy-duty palate profile, with extracted cherry, cola and vanilla flavorings decorating a firm, balancing structure.",88,30,California,Santa Clara Valley,Zinfandel
US,"The grapes come from three very widely separated vineyard sources. The Klipsun, says winemaker Marie-Eve Gilla, is for the backbone and tannins; the Pepper Bridge gives dried herbs and tighter tannins; and the Alder Ridge is more European and fills out the midpalate. This is showing very well, and has clearly benefited from the extra bottle age. It's beautifully integrated, with the tannins substantial but polished.

US,"The grape's fruit flavors of blackberry and black cherry are nicely focused and rounded, but the vanilla and tobacco components, perhaps from aggressive oak treatment, bring in a bit of bitterness to the tannins.

US,"The Kingpin Cabernet leans into the flavors of savory herb and leaf, with peppery accents to the light strawberry fruit. It's a pleasant, relatively light style that fades into a gentle finish.",89,62,Washington,Red Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The La Jota and W.S. Keyes vineyards are the sources for this classically styled wine that is intense and alive in minerality. Clove, black pepper and mountains of dried herb are front and center between firm, dusty tannin and oak. The texture is plush and velvety on the palate, with plenty of length on the finish.",95,85,California,Howell Mountain,Merlot
US,"The label doesn't tell you, but this is from the Firestone family's Curtis Winery vineyards in the Santa Ynez Valley. It's a very nice wine, especially at this price. A little too sweet, its orange, lime, lemongrass and vanilla flavors are balanced by crisp acidity.",86,13,California,Santa Barbara County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The label includes the words ‚ÄúOriginal Vines‚Äù written along the side, a nod to the history of this limited reserve, gleaned from vines planted by founder David Lett in 1965. It's steely and sharp edged, with sculpted fruit and limited use of new oak. Cellarworthy and distinctive, this wine rewards your attention and patience with unexpected layers of detail.",91,47,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Chardonnay
US,"The label is pretty, but the wine itself doesn't offer much. It's dry and thin, with simple Cabernet-like blackberry flavors.",81,7,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The label shows a pretty graphic of a young woman in flapper attire‚Äîthe actual Stella Fino. Clean, fresh and true to varietey, with appealing melon and apple flavors, this displays confident winemaking with an elegant touch.",88,18,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Pinot Gris
US,"The largest Chardonnay parcel in the Thomas Fogarty estate portfolio at slightly more than four acres, this slice still only amounts to four barrels of wine. The 2011 starts with a candied, chalky smell, reminiscent of white Smarties, and the flavors lean toward cooked stone fruit, such as caramelized pluot, and charred daffodil.",88,60,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Chardonnay
US,"The last vintage that the Melvilles are pulling from this Los Alamos Valley vineyard, this wine shows a complex nose of lemon candy, dill and fresh oregano. There is plenty of tension and grip on the palate, thanks to the lime-pith flavors, but a show of white flowers like tuberose keeps it properly ripe.",92,24,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
US,"The latest entrant into the Napa Cabernet sweepstakes succeeds with this flashy wine. Made from grapes grown in the warm Vaca Hills east of the Silverado Trail, this wine impresses immediately with aromatics of black currants, mocha and lightly toasted French oak. In the mouth, it's pure Cabernet pleasure, with soft, compelling tannins and fine acidity. It's a dramatic wine that should develop well over the next 10 years, if not longer. This is a winery to watch.",94,85,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The latest release of the H3 Chardonnay shows plenty of fruit upfront (20% was fermented in stainless steel). Firm, crisp apple and a buttery finish set this clearly in the mainstream Columbia Crest style.",87,15,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Chardonnay
US,"The latest vintage is the best ever for this cuv√©e. A succulent mix of apple and pear, a touch of pineapple, and a generous swath of butter, caramel and toasted nuts all comes together in a sure palate-pleaser. It spent 13 months in 40% new French oak, and fires on all cylinders, with perfect balance and compelling aromatics.",91,50,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The Laurelwood offers sharp flavors of pine tar, threaded through fresh fruit. Apple and orange are there in abundance, and the piny accents will be an interesting highlight for some tasters, but a distraction for others.",88,24,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"The leathery aromas and flavors all but obliterate the fruit, and turn the tannins chewy and bitter. There's a bare hint of cassis‚Äîthat's about it.",81,38,Oregon,Columbia Valley (OR),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The lees and peach aromas are quite light considering the variety. The stone-fruit flavors are reserved and pleasant, but the variety seems to get lost.",86,27,Washington,Rattlesnake Hills,Viognier
US,"The lemon, lime, pineapple and honey flavors are compromised by green mint notes in this dry, acidic wine. It has its limitations, but would make a good companion to a wide variety of fare, from potato salad to fried chicken.",85,14,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The light aromas suggest notes of star fruit and citrus. The palate is flavorful, with racy acids keeping the fruit in focus.",89,20,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Grenache Blanc
US,"The Limit seems to refer to bringing this Chard to the edge of oaky ripeness. Whether it goes beyond it is debatable. It's enormously rich and ripe in oranges, apricots, mangoes and oak, with good acidity and a creamy texture.",87,45,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"The Loner title seems to refer to an absence of oak, although it's not entirely unoaked. The wine spent time in what the winemaker calls ‚Äúseasoned barriques‚Äù that lent no overt oak influence, but let the wine breathe and mellow. Marked by intense lemon, lime and mineral flavors, this bone-dry wine is elegant and eccentric.",92,60,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The lovely, lushly fruity nose features plenty of buttery, roasted walnut scents from new oak fermentation. Despite the oak, it retains its freshness and acid balance, keeping it lively through a long, toasty finish.",89,50,Washington,Yakima Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The lush nose is fragrant of orange blossoms and ripe peaches, and the palate tastes of Meyer lemon, lime and grapefruit. It's a fruit punch of a Riesling‚Äîdelicious as a chilled sipper.",88,13,Washington,Yakima Valley,Riesling
US,"The Macari No 1 offers an aromatic nose of grapefruit and tropical fruit, followed by crisp citrus and mineral flavors. The wine is balanced and refreshing, but has complexity. Pair with Thai or Indian dishes.",86,27,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The main taste impression of this superripe Cabernet is of chocolate-covered raisins. Then the even riper notes of prunes emerge. The alcohol, which is 15.7% by volume, gives the finish a glyceriney sweetness. It will satisfy die-hard fans of this Napa style, but it's hard to see this clumsy wine developing in the bottle before the fruit crashes.",85,125,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The malolactic fermentation on this unoaked wine was blocked, so this is brimming with pure orange and lime flavors. The acidity is brisk and clean.",87,18,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"The melon, pear, tropical fruit and almond butter aromas are bright and effusive, while the flavors are considerably more delicate and subdued, showing a lovely sense of nuance and tension. It doesn't quite all come together but provides plenty of intrigue.",89,40,Washington,Yakima Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The mighty Insignia shows a vibrancy of purpose and craft in this, its 40th vintage, combining 88% Cabernet Sauvignon, 5% Petit Verdot, 3% Merlot, 3% Malbec and 1% Cabernet Franc. Together they find a higher calling of perfumed violet, dark plum and berry along with graphite and an edginess of dried herb. Firm, structured tannins show tremendous potential for aging and decanting. This is a near-perfect effort from a blockbuster vintage.",98,250,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"The mint-green bottle color presages the minty flavors of this dry, crisp wine. The fruit feels delicately balanced between underripe and fine, with suggestions of white peach and mango. It shows some real complexity, and the all-important acidity is wonderful.",87,15,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The mirror image of the winery's Love-Struck Viognier, this broad and fruity blend is forward and open, with flavors of yellow and orange fruits. It is slightly toasty, moving into some citrus skin flavors that frame the finish.",87,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Roussanne
US,"The mocha, spice and dark raspberry aromas seem quite locked-up at present. The red and black fruit flavors meanwhile show subtlety and depth.",90,34,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot

US,"The most apt word for this wine is hedonistic, which it is most definitely by design, trafficking in big, soft waves of rich, dense black fruit and mocha-chocolate. It delivers lushness and plenty of power, a formidable wine for formidable situations.",90,200,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The most easily accessible of J. Lohr's Bordeaux series, this Cabernet Franc-led ode to Saint-√âmilion opens with caramel, vanilla and cr√®me de cassis on the lavish nose. There is ample structure on the palate, with medium tannins, but it's soft enough to enjoy now, with rich fudge, clove and chai flavors laid across tasty black fruits.",94,50,California,Paso Robles,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"The most floral and lemony of Charles Smith's trio of Viogniers, this received extra time in barrel, yielding a more Burgundian mouthfeel‚Äîrich and creamy. Just 10% saw new oak, which seems to be exactly right, adding a hint of toast without clobbering the floral subtleties.",94,40,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier
US,"The most reserved of this winery's Grenache studies, this bottling shows baked red cherry, red currant, cola and slate on the nose. An iron-based minerality shows on the earthy palate, which also offers chipped slate, cranberry and tart cherry elements. It's a tad light but still intriguingly textured.",90,42,California,Ballard Canyon,Grenache
US,"The most structured of Sterling's recent releases and hence our favorite, the 2004 Diamond Mountain Ranch Cabernet boasts notes of cinnamon, cassis and clove, framed by firm tannins and finishing with a hint of anise. Drink 2008‚Äì2015.",91,65,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The mountain appellation speaks loudly in this wine, contributing juicy blackberry, tar and leather, all within a forested context of wild truffle and crunchy leaves. Concentrated and robust in body and ripeness, it unwinds slowly in the glass, imparting jolts of black pepper as it goes.",95,75,California,Mount Veeder,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,The mouthfeel has sandpapery tannins and some green peppercorn notes alongside riper flavors of blackberries and sweet currants. It's a rustic Zin to drink with barbecue.,84,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
US,"The mouthfeel on this wine is rustic, with a jagged edge that hints of green tannins. But it does have some good red cherry, currant, spice and oak flavors, and a certain elegance.",86,28,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
US,"The Naked Riesling is organically farmed and produced. This new vintage already seems a bit tired and has an unusually deep (oxidized?) golden color. It's drinking well enough, like a somewhat aged apple cider, but does not have the sort of freshness that one would hope for in a just-released 2007 wine.",85,12,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
US,"The name of this bottling, which included 6% Petite Sirah, implies youth, but a bit more age might be helpful for this rustic grape. Juicy and smoky aromas of ground coffee, blueberry, fudge and gravel show on the nose, while the palate presents tight raspberry, caramel and brisk oak flavors. It's interesting, though a tad thin.",87,34,California,Paso Robles,Tempranillo
US,"The name refers to the fact that the wine was both fermented and aged in stainless steel barrels. Made with Dijon clones from two different vineyards, it's fruit-driven, nicely flavored, offering melon, apple and white peach in equal proportion. It's a well-balanced wine, with clean, fresh flavors and just the right amount of acid to keep you reaching for the next glass.",89,18,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The Nashville-based R.S. Lipman Company, formerly just a Tennessee distributor, comes west for this deal of a wine, with lime blossoms, pink grapefruit and Gala apple slices on the nose. The palate is clean, crisp and rounded with lime spritzer and green-apple flavors.",88,15,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
US,"The new French oak (60%) and rich fruit aromas and flavors play perfectly off each other. Notes of dark roasted coffee beans and bittersweet chocolate meld with fresh herbs and dark cherries. It's rich and layered with abundant fruit and barrel flavors capped off by a tart, lingering finish. Best after 2020.",92,52,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"The new oak barrel flavors stick out aggressively, and help to create a strong impression of drying tannins. The fruit is light and chalky, with young vine flavors of generic red berries.",86,33,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Malbec
US,"The new oak on this Cab Franc is strong. So is the fruit, which suggests red cherries and blackberries so ripe the juice runs down your chin. But the wood and fruit haven't come together. They're slugging it out for supremecy. No reason to have to choose between them. Give it 6‚Äì8 years in a good cellar and let everything come together.",92,62,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Franc
US,"The new oak stands out and dominates this Chard, and while the toasty vanilla, caramel and charred woodsap flavors are pleasant, they overpower the modest pineapple and apple fruit.",85,40,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The new release from this old (1972) vineyard boosts the alcohol to 13.9%, dropping the residual sugar to just over 1%. Deep, concentrated, and driven by a dense minerality, this exceptional single-vineyard Riesling has raw fruit flavors of green apple, white peach and citrus rind. Sure to evolve, perhaps over decades, it has the vivid acidity and penetrating finish to improve significantly.",93,22,Washington,Yakima Valley,Riesling
US,"The No Girls Grenache, from a vineyard adjacent to Armada (the source for the Cayuse God Only Knows Grenache) is lighter, more elegant, perhaps brighter than its companion wine, with fresh blueberry and other pie berry  fruits, a streak of umami, herbal tea and impressive minerality. Almost Burgundian in style, it possesses excellent length and wonderful texture.",93,65,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Grenache
US,"The nose begins with a smoked Meyer lemon element, but evolves into fleshier tropicality, with ripe kiwi, white flowers and vanilla. The palate begins with vanilla, but then shows ripe stone fruits that trend toward bubble gum, with enough acidity and tannic grip to keep it serious.",89,24,California,Paso Robles,Viognier
US,"The nose is a tad high-toned, like apple juice concentrate from a can. It's full bodied and dry, with just a touch of sweetness on the palate, with a savory apple flavor that ends with a tart, green apple skin note.",81,18,Virginia,Virginia,Chardonnay
US,"The nose is a tad reductive at this point this wine's life, so it will probably only improve in the year to come. But it's exciting now as well, with candied lemon and dewy oregano on the nose leading into a racy palate full of sizzling acidity and grippy texture that clings to the mouth. A candied apple component flashes at the finish.",89,22,California,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The nose is full of baking spices, cinnamon and nutmeg, as well as blackberry and black currant, with a peppery note lingering under it all.

US,"The nose is mildly expressive, with zesty lemon in the forefront. The palate is a shows more intensity, offering juicy peach notes supported by a silky texture. Having spent eight months in 35% new oak, this trends toward a fruitier-style Chardonnay, with oak lending textural support.",86,22,Michigan,Old Mission Peninsula,Chardonnay
US,"The nose is packed with dark notes of desiccated strawberry, red currant and caramel lozenge, plus dried herb and maduro subtleties. Astringent, lip-grabbing tannins bolster the fleshy, medium- to full-bodied palate. A few more years of bottle aging should help mitigate some of the tannic blow, but enjoy it now with a brief decanting and a slab of grilled meat.",90,50,Virginia,Virginia,Merlot

US,"The nose is still emerging on this bottling by the historic estate, but nectarine, white and yellow flowers and a touch of cantaloupe are starting to peek out. The flavors dance between acidity and ripeness, with green apple flesh, lemon-lime peels and brisk minerality that build into a juicy finish.",91,26,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The nose of this Bordeaux-style blend is laden with blackberry, violets, clove and eucalyptus.

The tannins are smooth and toasty, which translates onto the long and dry finish.",89,55,Virginia,Virginia,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"The nose of this bottling from a stone-strewn vineyard in the heart of the appellation is very restrained, offering wet concrete, lime and lemon pith scents, with a touch of sweet chive.

US,"The oak is strong on this blend of three of the winery's best vineyards. It shows up as buttered toast, with a distinctive, charry-sweet note of toasted marshmallows. The wine is strong in pineapples and oranges. An eccentric Chardonnay for drinking now.",88,29,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The oak jumps out a bit, with plenty of vanilla and a bit of dill, too. A medium-bodied Merlot, still young and tannic and not yet unwrapped. Additional cellar time will help. ‚ÄîP.G.",87,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"The oak sticks out, dominating with toast and excessively sweet flavors. If you can get past that, you'll find a dry, crisp wine, with a note of pineapple.",82,15,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
US,"The oak, a mixture of French, American and Hungarian (with 50% new), takes the lead, with aromas of vanilla bean and toffee out in front of coffee and plum. The flavors are full bodied, sweet and generous, backed by grainy tannins.",88,30,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot

US,"The only varietally labeled Barbera from the Rocks District, this offers intriguing notes of currant, savory herb, pipe tobacco and moist earth. The palate is light in body, with a mix of fruit and savory flavors that carry through to the cranberry-inflected finish.",91,35,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Barbera
US,"The opening scent of funky, sweaty leather is not promising, and indeed, it tastes overly soft and muted. You can sense some good fruit in there, but it's tamped down. The tannins stick out, making the wine awkward and common.",84,65,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The opulence of this Chard comes at least as much from the buttered toast and caramel notes of oak, as it does from the underlying pineapple and tropical fruit flavors. It's a crowd pleaser. Drink now.",88,40,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The partner label of Black Cordon, also made by consulting winemaker Paul Hobbs, this entry-level offering blends small amounts of all the red Bordeaux varieties and ages in 80% new French oak.

US,"The Paso pioneer's annual bottling of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc does not disappoint, offering aromas of plump, dark blueberry, tart Bing cherry and bay leaf. The palate offers crushed herbs‚Äîfrom oregano and thyme to rosemary and dill‚Äîalongside more blueberry fruit and a solid yet smooth tannic structure.",94,72,California,Paso Robles,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"The Pocai Vineyard is a very interesting one, growing Chenin Blanc, Merlot, Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, and the wines are always worth looking into. This Cabernet Franc, at four years of age, is mellowing, with the tannins turning gentle and the flavors becoming delicious and dramatic. Particularly bright in red cherries, it's a beautiful wine for drinking over the next year or two.",92,30,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Franc

US,"The poster child for too much oak. Swamps with buttered toast, caramel, butterscotch and vanilla flavors that are so sweet, it's almost like a dessert wine. There's lots of tangerines, pineapples, apricots and apples, but those barrel influences are too much.",84,40,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The power and richness of Port fill this extreme‚Äîand extremely delicious‚ÄîZinfandel. It is very deep in color and vivid in aroma, like the scent of ripe grapes at the crusher on harvest day. It fills the mouth with apparent sweetness that lingers long on the finish. Perfect match for after dinner with blue cheese and toasted walnuts, or a cigar.",93,28,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
US,"The power of mountain fruit drives this young, impressive Zinfandel. It's a tight, tannic puppy right now, dry and aloof. But such are the massive blackberry, mulberry, espresso and pepper flavors that the wine should easily hold its own for many years. Best after 2008 and through 2013.",90,55,California,Mount Veeder,Zinfandel
US,"The pretty fruit flavors suggest relatively young vines, bringing light cherry to the front and center. Hints of marzipan, a flash of finishing heat and subtle chalkiness run through the finish. Another year or two of bottle age should continue to improve this one.",88,34,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Grenache
US,"The price is affordable, but this isn't a very satisfying wine. Despite fruity flavors, it's rough and bubble-gummy.",82,11,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The price on the Ethos Reserve has dropped significantly, making it an especially good value for a full-on, toasty and buttery Chardonnay.

The substantial texture and concentration stand out and add complexity. A lift of lemon meringue and spice complete the finish.",92,39,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The producer sources from older plantings of both Zin and Petite Sirah, of which there is 5% in this wine. Given more than a year in American oak, it's velvety on the palate with brown sugar, oak and high-toned raspberry, easily enjoyable on its own or on the table.",88,29,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel
US,"The producer sources primarily from its historic Rhinefarm Estate Vineyard for this wine, a rich expression of the variety opaque in color.

The lengthy finish is all about bittersweet chocolate.",92,50,California,Sonoma Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The producer's flagship wine, this vintage blends Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc.

US,"The producer's original source of Chardonnay, Sangiacomo grapes have figured into this wine since 1987, this vintage of which is astounding in tropical, fleshy layers of elegance, flecks of freshly cut pear providing further succulence.

US,"The raspberry aromas are bright and jammy. The flavors are sumptuous yet elegant, going down easy.",89,30,Idaho,Idaho,Merlot
US,"The reason why this winery scores so well, year after year, in Chardonnay is because the production team knows how to get maximum ripeness out of the grapes, while maintaining an integrity of structure. The '09 Hyde exhibits this quality. It's fantastically rich in oranges, apricots, pears and pineapples, yet possesses a bracing minerality and fine Carneros acidity.",93,55,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"The Reveler is Revelry's mainstay blend, a mix of roughly equal parts of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, and Merlot. Floral and powdered sugar scents lead into a light and pretty palate, showcasing red berry flavors and a touch of minerality.",88,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"The Ribbon Ridge estate delivers beautifully ripened fruit‚Äîso ripe, in fact, that the first impression is of sweet tree fruits, although the wine is actually quite dry. Peaches, citrus and nectarines are in the mix, and when the tangy acidity kicks in, a long, mineral-driven ride across the palate ensues. Luscious, long and detailed, this is a spectacular Riesling.",94,24,Oregon,Ribbon Ridge,Riesling
US,"The rich gold hue and the scents of bruised, slightly cooked fruit, suggest that premature oxidation is setting in. Two bottles were tasted, with comparable results. It's lemony, somewhat oily, penetrating and concentrated, but should be consumed now through 2017.",87,25,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Chardonnay
US,"The ripe berry flavors wear a veil of deeply toasted oak in this smooth and supple wine, but does it with finesse. Flavorful, smooth and not weighty, it has a pleasing, even texture on the tongue and displays good persistence with berry, pepper and dark toast flavors lingering on the back end. Perhaps over-oaked, but suavely so.",88,27,California,Redwood Valley,Zinfandel
US,"The ripest and strongest of the Lodi Native wines this year, this has raspberry and black pepper aromas tinged with dusty, earthy accents, and heavy flavors like stewed plums.",85,30,California,Mokelumne River,Zinfandel
US,"The Roman numeral 23 is an indication of the vineyard age; in the blend is 20% Cabernet planted at the same time. This is stiff and herbal, with brambly, wild raspberry and light cherry fruit and a dusty ash flavor as the tannins fade. Good length and balance.",87,35,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"The Rutherford vineyard has been the source of well-regarded Cabs for Monticello and the '04 is the latest. Compact and ageworthy, it shows well-ripened blackberry, cherry and cola flavors that have been generously oaked. The tannins are firm and sticky now, suggesting development. Best 2008‚Äì2012.",92,58,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"The scent of apple blossoms perfume this round, richly structured wine, accentuating flavors of apple and pear on the palate. Touches of vanilla and cream add weight and mouthfeel, but the wine finishes crisp with lemony acidity and saline minerality.",87,18,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Chardonnay
US,"The second vintage of this wine is a blend of 43% Grenache, 35% Syrah and 22% Mourv√®dre. Alluring aromas of red and black raspberries, plum, herb and spice are followed by action-packed, lively fruit flavors that linger on the finish. Feel plays as big of a role as flavor.",92,70,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),G-S-M
US,"The signature bottling from this winery, this very dark blend of 57% Cabernet Sauvignon, 17% Petit Verdot, 13% Malbec, 8% Merlot and 5% Cabernet Franc offers deep black plum and black currant as well as cigar box, smoked beef and caramel on the nose. A blackberry-pur√©e flavor leads the very fruit-driven palate, which is bolstered by black pepper, violet, shaved dark chocolate and espresso bean.",91,35,California,Paso Robles,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"The signature on the bottle is Gina Gallo's, and what a lovely Cabernet this is. It's rich, brimming with black currants, cocoa and oak, and the tannins are as smooth as velvet. Tastes so delicious now, there's no reason not to drink it up.",90,40,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"The sixteenth edition of Dunham's benchmark Cabernet Sauvignon bears a strong scent of new oak‚Äîit's aged in 70% French and 30% American. The wood is dominant, which is not surprising in a wine built for long term aging. Given plenty of time to breathe, bright red fruits, citrusy acids and a lovely mix of toast, caramel and clove accents emerge.",93,45,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The size of this wine distracts slightly from its thick, concentrated dark plum and blackberry brambly quality, the tannins soft and the oak able to stand behind the fruit. A syrupy, leathery and mocha finish seals the deal.",88,45,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel
US,"The smell of new leather and cigar box continues right into the flavors of this deep-colored, densely textured, quite tannic and full-bodied wine. That funky vein meets deep fruit flavors like black currants, so those who like a little adventure in their wine will love it.",91,25,California,Mendocino County,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,The smoky oaky aromas and spicy peppery flavors of this medium-bodied wine are undeniable and definitely dominate whatever modest fruit flavors lie underneath. It's an assertive wine with a brash flavor profile.,86,9,California,California,Chardonnay
US,"The soft but flavorful entry into a land of dark fruits, smoke and espresso barely hints at the wine to come. Give it time to breathe and it opens into a wonderfully complex, smooth and creamy wine with no rough edges. Pretty red fruit, seductive and lingering, is matched to hints of chocolate from 30 months in neutral barrels.",92,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Barbera
US,"The soft voluptuousness of this Cabernet Franc-based Bordeaux blend is its most evident feature. It has plenty of staunch tannins, but they're as finely woven as a silk tapestry, while the flavors are dazzling, suggesting black cherries, red currants and hints of dark chocolate and anise. Kudos to winemaker Aaron Pott for this remarkable blend from all around the valley. Drink now‚Äì2020.",94,125,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"The soft, silky quality of the tannins, fine acidity, and elaborate black cherry, currant, herb, anise and oak flavors make this elegant young wine fully ready to drink now, with equally fine food. Give it a few hours of decanting.",91,65,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The somewhat light red-purple color does not mean that this medium-bodied wine lacks flavor. Toasty, smoky, caramel aromas from oak carry over to the bold and almost sweet flavors, powering over moderate raspberry and plum undertones.",88,12,California,Lodi,Zinfandel
US,"The sour tang of green gooseberry immediately brings New Zealand to mind in this dry, tart Sauvignon Blanc. It's relieved by rich California notes of pineapples, pears and honey. Modern Chinese, Vietnamese, Japanese and Thai foods come to mind as ideal pairings.",88,24,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The sparkling wine producer shows off its prowess with still wines in this inaugural vineyard-designate from the well-loved Hyde. Tart lemon and green apple flavors highlight a brisk acidity that never tastes lean, and instead offers full-bodied luxury without the weight. Chameleon-like in that way, it's also juicy, structured and dotted in salty lemongrass.",91,44,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"The specs include 25% new oak, native yeast and partial malolactic to preserve acidity. On the nose it's barrel-rich, but surprisingly light in flavor, delivering a bright burst of citrus and green apple before deeper tones of honey and caramel settle in. It's smoothly textured, and the acidity provides good balance to the fleshy finish.",91,39,California,Mendocino,Chardonnay
US,"The spice, green herb, cedar, pepper and purple-fruit aromas are brooding and reserved, with a sprinkling of vanilla rounding it out. The elegant fruit and savory flavors show a fine sense of polish, with puckering tannins supporting it all. The focus is on elegance.",90,42,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Tempranillo
US,"The spiced dark-cherry and blackberry aromas come with a rusty edge, leading to a palate that's marked by vivid acids and trifling tannic support. In general, this is lithe and easy, a wine that would pair well with pizza.",83,19,New Mexico,New Mexico,Montepulciano
US,"The spritz on this Chenin Blanc gives this wine a sparkling appeal. The flavors of citrus fruits, green peas and vanilla are lovely.",89,15,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Chenin Blanc
US,"The squat Port-like bottle is the first indication that this is no ordinary Sauvignon Blanc. The juice was intentionally oxidized, then barrel fermented and aged on the lees. It's complex winemaking, and delivers a toasty textural wine with less snap and more softness that is usual with this grape. If you like the pricier barrel-fermented Sancerres, this is in your wheelhouse.",90,42,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Sauvignon Blanc

US,"The star of the lineup, this nicely-textured wine is a fine Chardonnay alternative. Fleshy pear, light citrus and a burst of Meyer lemon contribute equally. The length is what elevates this above the basic supermarket style.",89,14,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"The strong, green streak of gooseberries will divide wine lovers on this 100% stainless steel-fermented wine. It's absolutely dry despite low alcohol, with brisk acidity.",86,20,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The structure of this Cabernet Sauvignon (which includes small amounts of other Bordeaux grapes) shows lots of elegance, with refined tannins and acidity, plus a tasteful application of oak. Bone dry, it bears classic blackberry and black currant flavors. It will develop over the next six years, but is drinkable now.",93,100,California,Oak Knoll District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The structure on this wine is just fine, with crisp, coastal acidity and low alcohol making for a clean, well-balanced Chard. Its weakness is in the thinness of flavor. The wine is watery, with mere traces of citrus fruits and peaches.",82,13,California,California,Chardonnay
US,"The style is rich and ripe fruit, with the fruit pushing through into tropical. Nice handling of the oak adds just enough butter and light spice. A hint of bitterness mars the finish.",87,14,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
US,"The style is usually big and bold, but for the moment this wine, though dense and dark, has a hole in the middle. Rich scents of black cherry, blueberry and earth seem to vanish, leaving only a tannic finish.  ‚ÄîP.G",86,15,Washington,Yakima Valley,Merlot
US,"The Summum block sits at the vineyard's highest elevation, and seems to ripen more slowly and give extra complexity at lower sugar levels. Elegant and refined, with fruit flavors less in your face than its sister cuv√©es, this mixes citrus flavors of lemon, lime and pink grapefruit, along with lighter suggestions of pineapple and a hint of papaya. It's complex and captivating, with a long, racy finish.",94,90,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Chardonnay

US,"The sweet scent of raspberry and strawberry preserves waft from this Cab Franc icewine from Casa Larga. On the palate as well, there's a nice concentration of preserved berry flavors that soar on the palate with a bright, sunny acidity. Finishes clean and long with just a hint of autumn leaves and bramble.",87,75,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc
US,"The tang of orange rinds and fresh lemon cake meet with hints of toasted coconut and white flowers on the nose of this solid bottling by Bill Foley's eponymous winery. The texture is crisp but grippy and tense on the sip, with seared orange slices and oak smoke flavors.",92,45,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"The tannins are so ripe and sweet, so soft and intricate, in this decadently fruity, feminine wine. It has flavors of ripe blackberries, dusted with cocoa and sprinkled with tangerine zest. This is seriously good stuff, and impossible to resist.",92,25,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
US,"The tannins are still hard as nails in this five-year-old Cabernet. It's like chewing on sandpaper, but the black currant and cassis flavors are powerful. An old-fashioned wine that could develop over the years.",88,100,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The tannins on this Cabernet Sauvignon-based blend are strong. They numb the mouth, but not so much that you can't enjoy the ripe black currant, cassis and smoky oak flavors. With its inherent balance, the wine should have no trouble aging, so give it eight years in the cellar.",91,65,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"The tannins stand front and center in this mountain wine, but they're so finely textured, you hardly notice them. They glide over the palate, carrying along ultraripe blackberry flavors. A firm grounding of minerals provides additional structure. This rich Cabernet should develop bottle complexity over the next eight years.",90,60,California,Atlas Peak,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,The tarry herbal aromas and roasted peppery flavors of this medium-bodied wine give it a rather lean taste profile and the texture is moderately tannic.,84,23,California,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel
US,"The tawny color and slightly oxidized aromas suggest that this is a wine to be consumed as soon as possible. Though the alcohol is listed at a modest 12%, the fruit seems ripe enough. This was a difficult, wet vintage, and there are hints of spoilage in the finish.",83,15,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"The tech sheet for this wine nicely mentions how the vineyard is surrounded by both 100-year-old walnut trees and, what do you know?, marijuana. Does either influence the wine? It does show a muskiness but really its strengths are steely drops of extreme lemon, most decidedly on the long, exuberant finish.",87,15,California,Lake County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The Tempranillo‚Äîbud wood from Abacela‚Äîwas grafted onto 30-year-old Cabernet Sauvignon vines. Not sure how many vintages have been made, but it's too soon to rate the experiment. This is a lightly toasty, rather elegant red with little varietal character, but it's nicely built and perfectly fine for a simple supper.",85,26,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Tempranillo
US,"The term ‚ÄúRutherford Bench‚Äù is not a legal one, but colloquially refers to the west side of Highway 29, where the wines, supposedly, are better. And this is quite a good wine. It's fresh and young in sweet tannins and acidity; everything's not quite integrated yet, but it's a big, rich, complexly balanced wine. Should come into its own by 2008, then hold for some years.",91,45,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The texture could be smoother on this Chardonnay, as it's all sharp knees and elbows. But it shows proper ripeness, with orange, green apple and tropical fruit flavors, as well as plenty of sweet vanilla, cream and buttered toast.",87,25,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The texture is a bit sharp, and the flavors range from blackberry to prune on this everyday, dry Cabernet.",82,28,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The third release from this vineyard, this wine is juicy in fruit, tar and leathery tannins, a mix of raspberry, cassis and dark chocolate. From a dry-farmed site, with a small percentage of Petite Sirah, it was given less than a year in American oak and offers a taste of sweet tobacco on the finish. Drink now through 2020.",92,37,California,St. Helena,Zinfandel
US,"The toast, freshly ground coffee, dark chocolate and cherry aromas pop. Plum and chocolate flavors are smooth in feel and linger on the finish.",88,12,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"The Toreador bottling represents the best Zin winemaker Eric Cinnamon can make from the vineyard. So far, it's been a complex, ageworthy wine, and the '05 continues that tradition. Despite high alcohol, the wine is balanced, with firm tannins framing flavors of dried cherries and blackberries, pomegranates, red currants, leather, dark chocolate, briary nettles and smoke. It will happily take a decade of bottle age.",92,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Zinfandel
US,"The treatment here is fermentation in stainless steel, and the wine shows ripe, tart, tangy fruit. Mostly melon and kiwi flavors, good weight on the palate, and little if any oak.",87,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"The trick to getting a Cabernet Sauvignon this ripe and oaky is to provide balance, and in this, √âcluse has succeeded. Made from 100% Cabernet, it's enormously rich in blackberries and black currants, with dark chocolate, licorice and spice adding complexity. The tannins are, in a word, gorgeous. With high alcohol, the mouthfeel has a Cognac-like warmth, but doesn't feel uncomfortably hot. Drink now for fresh fruitiness.",92,69,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The trick with getting a Chardonnay this honeyed is to keep it balanced and make it finish dry. Lynmar accomplishes these tasks with dexterity. Partly because of the acidity, partly the stony, crystalline minerality. The wine is terrifically rich in tropical fruits, melons, sweet Meyer lemons and ripe summer peaches, with all the buttered toast you could ever want from oak. In lesser hands, it would all be too much.",94,55,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"The trick with Vognier is to take its exotic fruit and contain it with acidity and dryness. Swan's '09 accomplishes that task. It's big in tropical fruit and orange flavors, but crisp and minerally, and the finish turns dry and clean. A beautiful restaurant Viognier.",91,19,California,Russian River Valley,Viognier
US,"The Ukiah Valley gets hot, no doubt, but 15.8% alcohol on a Mendocino Cabernet is still hard to take. This wine is very tightly wound, a little hot, a little flabby with a minty, cedar nose and flavors of blackberry and chocolate that eventually come through.",84,24,California,Mendocino County,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The upside of the recession is that wines this good are being sold for lower prices, which is great news for consumers. This Cabernet, basically a n√©gociant's blend, is really delicious.

US,"The vineyard has been source to several wineries including Conn Creek, who had a successful 2002, but this '04 is a let-down. Despite some decent black currant and oak flavors the wine feels tannicly sharp and astringent, without charming softness, and does not seem capable of improving in the cellar.",84,45,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"The vineyard is on Howell Mountain. It's an awkward wine, with lots to like, but some problems. On the plus side is enormous  cassis, cherry and chocolate fruit flavor and rich, fine tannins, and the 100% new oak seems proper given the wine's volume. But there's too much sugary sweetness in the finish, almost like a dessert wine.",85,75,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
US,"The vineyard is one of the better Chardonnay sources in Alexander Valley, and in this fine vintage it lends ripe pineapple, pear, Key lime pie and Mandarin orange flavors to the wine.

Classic Burgundian-style California Chardonnay, rich and opulent.",92,36,California,Alexander Valley,Chardonnay

US,"The vineyard is south of the city of Napa, in a cool area, and the Merlot is traditionally ripe, dry and hard in tannins. The 2005 follows that formula. The new oak has not yet been integrated, and the wine is fresh, young and a little brash right now. But the tremendous heart of cherry, blackberry, chocolate and plum fruit suggests ageability.",90,55,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
US,"The vineyard is, of course, in Oakville, which makes you wonder why they put the generic Napa Valley on the label. The wine itself, which is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, is very dry and tannic.

Better left untouched for 6‚Äì8 years.",94,110,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The vineyard of gnarled, very old vines is on a picturesque stretch of West Dry Creek Valley road, and the wine shows classic old vine characteristics.

Give it an hour or two in the decanter and drink now.",94,75,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The vineyard, high in the Mayacamas Mountains, is famous for the tannic quality of its red wines. You'll find this '08 Cab tough and astringent. But you'll also easily discover the vast richness of chocolate, cherry, blackberry and currant fruit, so deep and impressive, and the finish is totally dry and balanced. This Cabernet clearly needs time. Give it until 2014 to begin to come around.",91,60,California,Sonoma Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The vineyard, long a source for Beringer's Cabs, is in the north-central valley, east of the Silverado Trail, just below Howell Mountain. It shows the hard, tough tannins of Cabs from that neck of the woods. Flavors of red currants, cherries and cocoa are rich and vibrant, but the wine is too astringent to open now. Hold until after 2010, and it should develop for an additional 6‚Äì8 years.",92,90,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The vineyard, on Spring Mountain, has been the source of very good Cabs from both Marston and Beringer, and the '04 continues that tradition. Made in the modern style, this is soft and very ripe to the point of sweetness. But it pulls back at the last minute, allowing the cassis, chocolate and red cherry flavors to finish dry. Best with something simple, like a grilled steak.",91,90,California,Spring Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The vintage conditions led to a sharply delineated, acid-driven Pinot Blanc in 2013. Tart with lip-smacking flavors of gooseberry, lime and celery, it also features grace notes of fresh herb. The strong focus and tight persistence make this one to enjoy over through 2020.",90,21,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Blanc

US,"The wine is 100% Cabernet, a combination of the winery's Palisades vineyard, in Calistoga, and Graveyard Hill, in Carneros. Strangely, it's not as good as either of those single-vineyard bottlings. It's too ripe, with stewed berry and raisin flavors that are almost Port-like.",85,80,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The wine is 100% Sauvignon Blanc. It was largely fermented and aged in stainless steel, but there is some minor French oak influence,  bringing a subtle soft smokiness. The fruit itself is exotic  and complex, ranging from Meyer lemons, limes and green apple to guava and pear. Dry and acidic, it's a gorgeous wine to drink now.",91,32,California,Bennett Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"The wine is fantastic, albeit tannic. It's not a gushy one to open tonight. The tannins have a dry astringency, but even so, you can taste fabulously ripe blackberries, black cherries and currants. This wine should begin to come into its own next year and hold for many years.",94,44,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"The wine is still showing a lot of rich new oak flavors: toast, coconut and vanilla cr√®me. Sur lie aging (in 100% French oak) adds plenty of texture and the impression of minerality. Behind the oak is a lush mix of fruits, from tangerine and pineapple through papaya and ripe banana.",91,36,Washington,Washington,Chardonnay

US,"The wine launched cinematically by Robert Redford in ‚ÄúIndecent Proposal,‚Äù this delivers a succulently memorable and seductive mix of crisp cassis and meaty rare beef, a sanguine underpinning that gives it intrigue.

US,"The winemaker pulled out all the bells and whistles, barrel fermenting this Chardonnay, putting it through partial malolactic fermentation, and aging it on the lees. The result is a rich, creamy wine, ripe in pineapple, orange, pear, vanilla and honeysuckle flavors, and brightened with brisk Carneros acidity. Shows impeccable balance, at a fair price.",91,25,California,Carneros,Chardonnay

US,"The winery actually released this wine after the 2007, no doubt to give it the extra bottle age needed. Nonetheless, it's still quite tannic, bringing to mind an older style of Howell Mountain Cabernet. It's refreshing to have an ageable alternative to the soft, sweet modern style. Rich in mountain blackberries and sweet currants, this wine should develop over the next decade.",94,59,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The winery aims for Loire valley characteristics in its wines, hence the reference to C√¥t, as Malbec is known in the region. This is grapy, purple and young.

US,"The winery has hardly changed its winemaking formula over the decades. Gravelly Meadow remains toughly closed, dry and tannic in youth, despite its core of blackberry and cherry fruit. While the wine is flamboyantly forward by Diamond Creek standards, it would be a crime to drink it before 2020. It's so balanced and complex, it will easily age until then, and probably far longer.",94,200,California,Diamond Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"The winery has made SB since 1982, blending in S√©millon and barrel-aging in new oak to craft a fuller style of the wine that's well structured.

US,"Their estate Chardonnay is all barrel fermented. A bigger style, with lots of texture but not too much oak. Leesy, creamy, with buttery, tropical fruit. Again, well-balanced and stylish.",88,18,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Chardonnay
US,"There are a number of lovely Cab Francs coming from the Finger Lakes, but the smell of ripe red cherries accented with rich mocha, vanilla and smoke make Atwater's especially enticing. Lusciously fruity on the palate with intense blackberry and raspberry flavors, it's balanced with rustic notes of bramble, herbs, earth and violets. Soft tannins and smoke carry through to a long finish.",88,18,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc
US,"There are distinct and pleasant aromas of chalk and pear on the nose of this Grenache Blanc, one of the many Rh√¥ne-style wines made by this winery run by the family of the late actor-turned-vintner Fess Parker. It's a very straightforward sipper, not hugely complex, but refreshing and bright with slight nectarine flavors and lush pear.",86,25,California,Santa Barbara County,Grenache Blanc
US,"There are drying tannins and an earthy underpinning to this bottling of the Gravity Merlot. The cherry and cassis flavors have good grip, leading into a coffee-coated finish.",88,24,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Merlot
US,"There are intriguing touches to the nose of this bottling, with jasmine, sea salt, wet hay, quinine and rainy sidewalk. The structure on the sip is quite delicate, with golden apple and honey flavors.",86,26,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"There are light and airy elements of nectarine flesh and lemon blossoms on the nose of this first Chardonnay ever made by veteran Doug Margerum, who also imparts warmer scents of toast and clarified butter. The palate is tightly coiled, simultaneously soft with stone fruit and sharp with chalky texturality.",93,48,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay

Drink now as it doesn't have the structure for aging.",87,36,California,Dry Creek Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"There are odd hints of plastic in the nose and in the flavor, along with black-cherry fruit. In the mouth this wine feels disjointed, with a chalky, short finish and a hint of coconut.",84,28,Oregon,Southern Oregon,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"There are only a few drops of Syrah in this Cab, but you can taste them in the violets, cherries and pepper that complicate the cassis flavors. It's a good wine, although a little heavy and soft.",86,50,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"There are pleasant green elements on the nose, and it's light and racy on the palate, with pepper and blackberry flavors, before the mouth-drying tannins arrive. An affordable yet bold Cabernet.",87,12,California,Central Coast,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"There are solid Cabernet flavors of blackberries and black currants in this dry, tannic wine. It's rough and astringent in the mouth, without much charm, but a rich steak, maybe topped with a gorgonzola sauce, will make it shine.",85,34,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"There are some curious, almost Syrah-like elements to this bottling from a rural region between Santa Clarita and Palmdale, but it's an interesting wine. Aromas of concentrated blueberry and blackberry meet with tar, peppercorn and black licorice on the nose. Then the palate shows dark fruit with fennel, oregano, marjoram, black-olive and beef-crust flavors.",88,26,California,Sierra Pelona Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"There are some elegant floral highlights in the nose, leading into a fairly substantial mouthful of mixed citrus, apricot and peach fruit. Bigger than most Oregon Pinot Blancs, this has a round, fruity flavor with a hint of sweetness.",87,12,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Blanc
US,"There are some fine flavors of cassis and cedar in this dry Merlot-based Bordeaux blend, but it has textural challenges in the tough tannins and cutting acidity that seems to come from green fruit or stems. Drink now.",85,56,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"There are some problems here, beginning with a vegetal, asparagus smell and ending with a soft, simple syrup finish. In between are some decent cherry flavors wrapped into harsh tannins.",82,21,California,Carneros,Merlot
US,"There are some toasty, Graham cracker highlights in the nose, leading into a full, round wine with lemon verbena accents. Fruity, soft and broad, with apple and melon.",86,11,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
US,"There are still some rough edges here: hints of volatility, burnt wood notes and unintegrated barrel flavors. But there is substantial red fruit at the core, and it's got plenty of punch and power to stand up to a smoky barbequed meal.",86,26,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Tempranillo
US,"There are very distinctive botanical aromas on this wine, from salted orange peels to juniper bush, almost like a gin. The palate is also incredibly herbal, with dried dill, marjoram and basil, which makes for a very interesting sipper though perhaps a bit odd for some.",86,18,California,Central Coast,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"There are very savory aromas on this wine, with campfire smoke and herb-crusted game dominating the boysenberry fruit in the background. The tannins are edgy, and toasted oak flavors persist in a pleasant way, with black cherry and licorice present as well.",88,65,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"There aren't many Cabernet Sauvignons from Napa County at this price point, so this one stands out for its concentration and simple cherry, clove and vanilla flavors wrapped in smoky oak. Perfumed and crisp with acidity, it's food-friendly and ready to be enjoyed.",86,25,California,Napa County,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"There aren't very many Cabernets from the small Chalk Hill appellation in eastern Sonoma County. This one is excellent, a worthy follow-up to the winery's 2007, offering smooth and rich tannins, with elaborate blackberry, cherry, cassis and mocha flavors. New oak plays a dominant role, but it should recede as the wine integrates over time. Give it 6‚Äì8 years in the cellar.",94,75,California,Chalk Hill,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"There has been an impressive jump in quality over the past few vintages, along with a price drop. What's not to like? This young, lightly spritzy wine is a fresh summer drink with immense appeal. Scents of white flowers, flavors of pears and highlights of tangerines, continue into further flavors of pink grapefruit and clean rock. The low alcohol suggests that there is a touch of residual sugar, but the wine finishes dry.",90,14,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"There have been Estate Selection Chards from Cuvaison before, but never a block bottling. This wine fully merits its status and price. Tightly angular and acidic in youth, it's very minerally, with a gunmetal tang to the oak-infused Meyer lemon, green apple and green pear flavors. One of the rare California Chardonnays not ready on release, this Chablis-style wine will be best in mid-2008, and should develop for another few years.",93,36,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"There is a creamy, leesy mouthfeel to this estate-grown Riesling, whose residual sugar is masked with acidity. Tart apple and pear fruit flavors finish with lighter notes of candied orange and citrus.",87,14,Washington,Yakima Valley,Riesling
US,"There is a great deal of restraint exercised in this bottling from this warmer SoCal region, with tightly wound blackberry, black currant and turned loam on the nose. The flavors are also still wrapped up firmly, with more black currant, asphalt and gravel hidden behind sticky tannins. This wine is still young and should age well.",89,60,California,Temecula Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"There is a healthy dose of 22% Petit Verdot in this bold, juicy wine, rich in wild raspberry and cassis aromas and flavors. Graphite and chocolate fill out the dense, integrated midpalate, complemented by tangy acidity that provides structure and a hint of grace.",92,60,California,St. Helena,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"There is a lovely balance to this Viognier, and a sense that these cool-climate grapes were not pushed too far. The winemaker, happily, chose to make the wine that the vineyard gave her. Delicate and layered, with paper-thin suggestions of citrus rind, grapefruit and white peach. Still tightly knit, this wine very slowly unwinds long after you've swallowed that first sip or two.",89,19,Washington,Lake Chelan,Viognier

US,"There is a strong underpinning of mineral in this wine, supporting crisply defined flavors of melon, pineapple and citrus peel. A medium-ripe, medium-weight, supremely well-crafted and balanced Roussanne.",88,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Roussanne
US,"There is an insane amount of power in this wine, sourced from the mighty Bedrock, where the Zin is interplanted with Petite Sirah and Alicante Bouschet. Blueberry, candied orange and rosemary complement one another, while a dustiness and minerality play tricks on the tongue, testifying about the vineyard's rocky soils.",90,43,California,Sonoma Valley,Zinfandel
US,"There is earthy darkness and a hint of the forest in this Zin, grown at high elevation in the rocky soils of the Rockpile appellation, these vines planted in 2001. The wine is magnificently structured with complex, ripe blackberry and cherry compote coming to the fore slowly and seductively.",93,50,California,Rockpile,Zinfandel
US,"There is impressive depth to the nose of this bottling, with concentrated black cherry, black plum and blueberry fruit enhanced by white pepper, roasted meat, licorice and hot asphalt. The palate is awash in savory flavors, with soy, charred beef and tobacco followed by waves of blueberry and leather and a wash of vanilla, plum skin and mocha, all atop perfectly polished tannins.",95,50,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"There is just 9% Cabernet in the blend. Smooth and light, with lean flavors showing herb and bark. The tannins have a green edge to them, and perhaps as a result, the vanilla flavors  seem to stick out rather awkwardly.",86,22,Washington,Yakima Valley,Merlot
US,"There is just a hint of volatile acidity, enough to brighten the nose, which has Bing cherry and chocolate as well. In the mouth, the fruit has some herb and dill to it, an indication of a cooler vintage, and some fairly stiff tannins. ‚ÄîP.G.",87,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"There is loads of freshly crushed black pepper in this dry, robust Zin. It's almost enough to make you sneeze. You'll also find good blackberry fruit and heady alcohol. Drink up.",85,17,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel
US,"There is lots to like in this Chablis-like Chardonnay. It's dry, bright in acidity and minerally, with an undercurrent of citrus, Asian pear and tropical fruit flavors. Oak plays a subtle but essential part in the wine's richness.",90,21,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
US,"There is plenty of red cherry and currant in this Cab, blended with a quarter's worth of Merlot, Malbec, Petite Sirah and Petit Verdot. The thin, balanced layers also recall anise and vanilla.",87,28,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"There is potential in this wine that bodes well for the future of Sangiovese in Virginia. The nose is charming, with mocha, fall leaves and cherries that slide into a silky palate with woodsy touches. Juicy, raspberry-inflected finish. Try with steak. Drink now.",84,23,Virginia,Virginia,Sangiovese
US,"There is so much wood on the nose of this bottling that it smells like an oak stave mill, with shaved cedar and maduro cigar touches dominating the black-currant and elderberry fruit. That cedar is powerful on the sip too, with a touch of black-cherry fruit managing to pop out along with dried herbs.",85,60,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"There is some volatility in the nose, along with strong scents of the new French oak. But the flavors are substantial and bring tart fruit with black olive, toast and coffee highlights. The acidity seems chalky, but it's a noticeable improvement from previous vintages.",87,35,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"There is tons of lively action packed into the nose of this wine, from rosebuds and zesty cherry cola to cinnamon spice and rainbow peppercorns. The texture is relatively light on the sip, and yet grippy tannins and a bursting acidity swim across the palate, showing vibrant iron and red-fruit flavors.",90,25,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Grenache
US,"There is very little to distinguish any of the 2010 Maryhill Cabernets from each other. This shows a dash of cassis, with a big streak of vanilla and just a hint of orange peel.",84,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Franc
US,"There isn't much Zin in Washington, but this makes a good case for more. Thick and tannic, it's a meaty, dark wine that includes 25% Petite Sirah. Seventeen months in new American oak has left an indelible whisky-barrel scent. ‚ÄîP.G.",87,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Zinfandel
US,"There may be an interesting wine lurking in the dark shadows here, but the oak and alcohol are overpowering in ways that mask the plummy cinnamon within.",82,30,California,South Coast,Sangiovese
US,"There was no oak used on this stainless steel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc, but it does contain a splash of Viognier. It's dry, crisp in acidity and savory in lime, orange, kumquat and vanilla flavors that finish long and clean. It will pair with everything from bruschetta with olive tapenade to fried chicken, Chinese food and sushi. Easy to find, with 190,000 cases produced.",89,13,California,California,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"There's 19% Syrah and 5% Petite Sirah blended in, making for a succulent wine, with spicy, lively fruit leading the charge. There's enough acid to give it structure and balance, but not so much that the wine seems edgy or sour. Full bodied, mouthfilling, flavorful and distinctive.",92,24,California,Mendocino,Zinfandel
US,"There's a bit of oak in this Riesling, just enough to give some mellowness to the tart apricot, citrus and white flower flavors. It's bone dry and acidic, with a mineral intensity that finishes with elegance and style.",87,38,California,Spring Mountain District,Riesling
US,"There's a bittersweet tartness to the tannin profile within this wine that is otherwise dusted in cedar, dried herb and black currant. With a big, full-bodied presence of oak, it shows ripe and robust fruit character and plenty of bite.",86,85,California,St. Helena,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"There's a brown sugar, candied edge to the raspberries and cherries of this 100% Cabernet. Plenty of caramelized oak, too. The result is a soft wine that grows cloying after a while.",85,45,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"There's a chalky tartness to this young wine, a single-vineyard designate from a consistent source. Gravenstein apple and a suggestion of honey star on the nose and palate around a medium body and finish.",85,25,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"There's a cider-like tone to this spry semisweet wine. Bruised apple and pear flavors balance savory and sweet against a backdrop of zesty lemon. It's a rustic, yet refreshing, Riesling for everyday enjoyment.",85,18,New York,Seneca Lake,Riesling
US,"There's a classic style to this Cabernet, from the enticing aromas of cassis, black cherry and licorice to the sizable yet velvety tannins that wrap flavors gracefully. Structured and medium in weight, the wine has a sense of restraint plus a balance of acidity and lushness. Enjoyable now, it will benefit with time, through 2020.",92,95,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"There's a crushed nut aroma on the nose of this bottling, along with sour tangerine and chamomile. Dried lemons and lime peels show on the sip, which is bitter with pithy flavors and framed with a bit of acidic zip.",86,75,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
US,"There's a deep sense of crushed rock minerality in this bottling, which is rare for a variety typified by rose petals and red fruit. It's darker on the fruit front, with black raspberry and elderberry on the nose along with sagebrush, turned loam and dust. The palate adds boysenberry, eucalyptus, fennel and light but impactful tannins to the mix, making for a very complex wine.",92,38,California,Central Coast,Garnacha
US,"There's a delicate lemon scent, leading into a mix of citrus, grapefruit peel and honeysuckle. The wine gains weight in the mouth, showing ripe fruit (yellow apples) and a soft, lightly oxidized finish with toasted coconut and cracker. Quite delicious, distinctive and rich.",90,15,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Blanc
US,"There's a delightful note of herbs and green olives to this Bordeaux-style Cabernet, although it also shows plenty of red cherries and black raspberries. With smooth, refined tannins, it's just superb for drinking now, although it should age well in a cool cellar.",92,50,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"There's a disagreeable sharpness and harshness to this Merlot. Despite some pleasant cherry, berry and oak flavors and a lush texture, that rough tartness persists through the finish.",84,30,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
US,"There's a distinctive old-school quality that comes from these century-old vines, which make a slightly lighter wine with intriguing, almost pre-aged aromas of dried cherry, balsamic raspberry and salt-and-pepper spice. The palate is driven by a crushed rock texture and a bright acidity that drives deep into the finish, with flavors of aged cola and dried red fruit. It's even greater with a slight chill.",92,38,California,Santa Clara Valley,Grenache
US,"There's a distinctly floral grapiness to this Malbec‚Äîevocative of Argentinian archetypes‚Äîyet rustic touches of bramble wood and a delicate, dancing mouthfeel make it quite uniquely a New Yorker. Blackberry and cherry flavors are rich and ripe, yet maintain vivacious freshness through the finish.",89,22,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Malbec
US,"There's a dullness to this wine, which flirts with the idea of plum and cherry flavor yet gets somewhat bogged down in marshmallow. Light bodied, it presents with more ripe sweetness than it may actually have.",84,15,California,Sonoma County,Merlot
US,"There's a faint hint of pink in the color of this bright, cheery, light and appetizing wine. It combines flashes of crisp green apple with ripe pear, golden cherry and white peach for a cornucopia of delicious fruit flavor.",88,14,California,Mendocino County,Viognier
US,"There's a fascinating presence of herb-roasted chicken to the well-balanced nose of this Chardonnay from the historic Brousseay Vineyard, alongside chalky minerality, golden apple and Asian pear. Once sipped, it's very easy on the palate, with baked apple, wet stone, slight kiwi and a noticeable salinity.",91,45,California,Chalone,Chardonnay
US,"There's a feral element to this vineyard-designate, the producer's only one from Napa Valley, from a vineyard planted originally in 1930. Extracted and thick, it offers plum, blackberry and raspberry around big, broad shoulders of mocha and oak. And as always, there's a hint of mint.",90,37,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel
US,"There's a fresh taste of green herbs to the 2010 ‚Äú1772‚Äù that must be the result of the unusually cool vintage. It's by no means unwelcome, giving a minty, peppery tang to the green apple, tangerine and lime fruit. Drink now.",89,44,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
US,"There's a funky herbal, slightly green quality to this wine, possessed of plenty acidity, as the variety is known for, yet muted in its typical floral aromatics and bright fruit.",84,30,California,Sonoma Valley,Barbera
US,"There's a good array of purple-flower aromas, including lavender and potpourri, on the nose of this bottling, as well as light cola and plum skins. The sip is quite bitter and tarry though, with just a touch of riper black fruit.",86,38,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Cabernet Franc
US,"There's a good wine in here that wants to get out, but it will take some time. Even though this Bordeaux blend is more than four years old, it's still stiff in tannins, with a dry, withering mouthfeel. But there's a solid core of black currants. Give it until 2010, at least.",91,60,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"There's a hard, metallic flavor and feeling. Under that are good black cherry and cola flavors, touched with sweet, smoky oak. It's okay with basic burgers and barbecue.",83,30,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Cabernet Franc
US,"There's a heaviness to this 76% Cab blended with 7% Petit Verdot, 6% Merlot, 6% Cab Franc and 5% Malbec. A muscular, powerful wine, it's intense in hay and herb, the finish veering savory to the point of sour.",85,85,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"There's a layer of sweetness to this viscous wine, which exudes aromas of graham cracker and pear, finishing in a light coating of lemon.",85,25,California,Sonoma County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"There's a lemony leanness to this exquisite wine, from one of the most esteemed vineyards in its region, a site the producer has worked with for more than 20 years. Balanced, it opens with inviting aromas of white flowers and orange peel before delving into complex layers of fresh citrus, ginger snap and lavender.",94,60,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"There's a lightly spritzy tickle in the mouth, and a metallic undertaste to this Chardonnay. The blend includes 5% each Pinot Gris and Sauvignon Blanc, all done in stainless steel. Thin and a bit green, it does not quite come together.",83,12,Washington,Washington,Chardonnay

US,"There's a lot of lees influence on this wine, which gives it a sourdough taste and creamy mouthfeel. It's dense in tropical fruit, citrus, green apple and honey notes, with a touch of sweet, smoky oak. A dry, complex, multilayered wine, this will gain traction with 2‚Äì4 years in the cellar.",94,35,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay

US,"There's a lot to admire in this producer's entry-level wine in terms of price and complexity, a blend of 71% Cabernet Sauvignon with 25% Merlot and 1% each of Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, Malbec and Syrah. Burnt wood and herb underlie full-bodied, sizable waves of black-fruit flavor, graphite, tar and coffee.",91,35,California,Alexander Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"There's a lot to admire in this robust wine, from its soft, muddled layers of spicy cinnamon to its well-hewn bursts of black licorice and blackberry. While full-bodied and brooding, it drinks with elegance and a brightness of red fruit on the finish.",90,25,California,Northern Sonoma,Zinfandel

US,"There's a lot to like in this nicely priced white, a blend of several regional vineyards. A taste of hazelnut expands on the palate to meet creamy Tahitian vanilla. Approachably round, this crowd-pleasing wine finishes in measured, integrated oak.",90,18,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"There's a lovely sweetness to the fruit, which tastes like ripe, just-picked blackberries. Old vines, 100+ years, deliver sweet, supple, sexy fruit. The wine has very dry tannins, and it might profit from some blending, but with a vineyard this special you have to admire the single-vineyard approach.",93,28,California,Contra Costa County,Zinfandel
US,"There's a maturity that shines through from the honeyed applesauce and steel aromas in this off-dry Riesling. Rich and full bodied on the palate, bright, fresh apple and lemon flavors linger elegantly on the tongue with a hint of bitter lime pith.",86,13,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
US,"There's a minty, ammonia streak of greenness that can charitably be described as gooseberry in this dry Sauvignon Blanc. Oak brings sweet vanilla richness, but the wine is still pretty eccentric.",84,24,California,Sonoma Valley,Sauvignon Blanc

US,"There's a pleasantly oxidized element to this wine from Michael Mooney (who also makes Chateau Margene from Paso Robles' Creston district). Aromas recall honey and dried apricots, mangos and bananas. The flavors carry that forward, with caramelized apples, melted marshmallow and all types of dried fruit, but with lots of acidic verve too.",92,46,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
US,"There's a reason this is one of the pricier white wines from the region. Aromas of yogurt and brie cheese are leveled by struck match, smoked grapefruit skins and sourdough. Vibrant lime pith and singed lemons fuel the palate, which further benefits from crushed oyster shell rockiness and goat cheese-like pungency. The mouth sings with remarkable acidity that will evolve. Drink 2018‚Äì2024.",94,75,California,Monterey,Chardonnay
US,"There's a reduced quality to this wine and much ado about oak, in which it spent time (30% new French). Founder and winemaker Mark Lyon owns the 122-acre site where the Sauvignon Blanc blocks date back to 1973. A hit of jalape√±o dominates on the finish.",83,22,California,Alexander Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"There's a rubbery denseness to this wine, a curious, not entirely pleasant mix of red currant and burnt leather that may or may not integrate over time.",82,30,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
US,There's a savage appeal (what the French call sauvage) to this unabashedly rustic Cabernet Franc that was fermented entirely using wild yeasts. Initial notes of tomato leaf and green stem blow off to reveal aripe red fruit with a gorgeously floral character. Tart acidity and a concentrated red-cherry flavor are accented with graphite and black tea notes.,88,20,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Cabernet Franc

US,"There's a shrillness to this wine, rich in overripe, preserved lemon and a daunting taste and aroma of oak. The body and weight of the wine don't overpower, but the fruit and oak don't seem in balance.",83,32,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
US,"There's a slight, lithe line of butterscotch on the nose of this bottling, with lots of lemon blossoms and Meyer lemon juice overshadowing the buttery aspect. The palate is tart in green apple and Anjou pear flavors, followed by honeydew and white peach.",90,40,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
US,"There's a slightly pink hue to this wine from Lompoc's Norman Yost. The nose is bright and minerally, with strawberry, apple cider and slight watermelon aromas. There's even more going on once sipped, with pear spritzer and citrus zest playing along with gray rocks and elements both bitter and sour. It's a refreshing take on a grape that doesn't always get the rock star treatment.",91,22,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"There's a smoky, char-like quality to this wine, a blend of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Petit Verdot. Soft and supple on the palate, dried tobacco and cherry intermix, along with leather and coffee, letting the more savory elements speak loudly. It finishes with a hint of sage.",88,70,California,Dry Creek Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"There's a sour twinge on the nose that's reminiscent of sweet apple cider vinegar, but the dry, medium bodied palate is pleasant with fresh apple juice flavors and a touch of cream on the finish.",82,20,New York,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay
US,There's a spicy cinnamon character to this wine that's otherwise flush in blackberry and chest-pounding ripe fruit and oak.,86,30,California,Oakville,Merlot
US,"There's a steely polish to this laser-focused dry Riesling. Crisp apple, lemon and grapefruit flavors are refreshing, but serve more as a backdrop to intense minerality. It's a brisk yet penetrating wine with a long, linear finish. Drink now‚Äì2017.",90,18,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
US,"There's a stewy rustiness to this wine on the entry, an evocative recall of the old country, when grandfather made wine in his basement. From a high-elevation vineyard site, it takes time to open. Once it does, the full-bodied expression of juicy blackberry and leather combine to nice effect.",88,45,California,Sonoma Valley,Zinfandel
US,"There's a strong dose of green gooseberry in this wine that makes it distinct, although you'll also find riper notes of limes and grapefruits. It's quite dry and crisp with acidity, finishing with mouthwatering tartness.",86,23,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"There's a strong nose on this single-vineyard from a reliable appellation in the middle of Monterey County, with white floral, crispy apple and light honey aromas. It's zesty with tongue-singeing acidity, showing flavors of dried apples, lime juice and honeydew melon.",91,30,California,Arroyo Seco,Chardonnay
US,"There's a strong peachy scent to the nose of this bottling, but it's bolstered by sea salt and a scratched lime-skin freshness. The lime flavor is prominent on the sip, from pith to juice, and there is decent tension along with honeydew flavors.",87,29,California,North Coast,Chardonnay
US,"There's a substantial earthiness to this Chardonnay, grown in a relatively cool estate vineyard. Vibrant on the palate in ripe apple and lemon, it offers medium weight and body, with a crispness to the finish and a food-friendly nature.",88,60,California,Carneros,Chardonnay

US,"There's a tannic toughness to this young wine. It's like chewing on dried black currants. Once they start to dissolve in the mouth, lovely flavors of sweet blackberries emerge, and then take over through a very long, spicy finish. It's quite a beautiful Napa Cabernet, but it does need time. Best 2013‚Äì2019.",94,82,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"There's a tawny edge to this wine, suggesting that it's quickly maturing and should be consumed soon. That said, it's drinking very well, with a slightly roasted, nutty character over soft strawberry/cherry fruit. Hints of pine needle and cured meat add further flavor interest.",89,29,Oregon,Umpqua Valley,Tempranillo
US,"There's a thin line between attractive gooseberry and hay aromas, and more severe pungency. This wine is strong in the latter.",81,16,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"There's a tinge of herbaceous green stem amidst fresh apple and lemon aromas on this Sauvignon Blanc blended with 10% Albari√±o. Marked with nervous lime acidity, it's lean on the palate with a hint of lime-skin bitterness on the finish.",85,18,New York,Finger Lakes,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"There's a ton of oak on this wine. It dominates the underlying fruit flavors, which are actually quite pleasant, offering ripe tropical fruit and pear flavors. But the caramelized, charred wood taste dominates, resulting in an unbalanced Chardonnay.",85,40,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"There's a touch (17%) of new oak here, which adds flavors of caramel and vanilla to the rather tart and simple fruit. It falls into the generic yellow/green apple style, with hints of arugula.",87,35,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
US,"There's a touch of honeyed sweetness to this wine that gives it a softly appealing taste. The orange, apricot, tropical fruit and vanilla flavors are absolutely delicious, while there's just enough acidity to lift and balance the richness.",88,30,California,Bennett Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"There's a touch of hot asphalt, pencil lead and miso on the nose of this first vintage from a promising, well-funded project, with dark elderberry fruit and dried dill rounding out the aromas.

US,"There's a touch of tropicality on the nose of this bottling, albeit a restrained version, showing green papaya, underripe pineapple, pink-grapefruit rind and lemon curd.

US,"There's been no price increase for this outstanding value, but the quality keeps going up and up. It's packed with juicy red berry and cassis fruit‚Äîsupple, tangy, deep and lingering. The finish carries a suggestion of chalk, more in the sense of minerality than any artificial dryness.",91,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon

The wine itself is dry and firm in tannins, with blackberry and chocolate-covered raisin flavors. The alcohol is a refreshingly low 12.5% by volume. A great accomplishment. Production was 4,000 cases.",88,12,California,California,Merlot
US,"There's meaty leather and sizable tannin in this mountain-grown Malbec, from an Atlas Peak vineyard sought after for many types of red grapes. Time in bottle has served it well, the bolder aspects and jammy blackberry and blueberry fruit softened by balanced acidity.",92,55,California,Napa Valley,Malbec

The hot alcohol suggests it will not age.",86,125,California,Spring Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is a best barrels selection. It's the densest, most tannic of David Arthur's current releases, a massive wine stuffed with black currants, blackberries, anise, tobacco and smoky new oak. Best of all, it's dry, dry, dry. Fine now, if you're into young wines, but should age well in a good cellar for many years.",95,135,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This 100% Cabernet Sauvignon is clean and almost delicate, with cranberry fruit, red licorice, dry leaves and drying tannins. It fades rather quickly, but would make a nice companion to a simple skirt steak.",86,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon

Hold for at least six years and see what happens.",93,150,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This 100% Cabernet tastes way too oaky. Vanilla cream and caramel dominate the blackberries and black currants, giving it a woody sweetness. The question is, will it age out?

US,"This 100% Cabernet, from the iconic Klipsun vineyard, has been sourced from the original 1989 planting since the first crop, making Seven Hills Klipsun's longest standing customer. This offers deep cassis, mineral, and earth flavors, powerful and dense. The Seven Hills style, ordinarily restrained and elegant, suits this vineyard especially well, as it reins in the tendency of Klipsun fruit to go over the top, and become too tannic. This is muscular and deep, but proportionate and detailed.",93,32,Washington,Red Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This 100% Cabernet's dark, saturated color testifies to its extracted ripeness and richness. It's a gigantic wine, buried at the moment under smoky oak, but tremendous underneath in blackberry, cherry, currant, sweet herb, violet and cured meat flavors. A big success even in this vintage.

US,"This 100% estate-grown Cabernet carries some of the identifying aromas of the Rocks, a part of Walla Walla where vineyards are planted on a dry river bed.

Tasted in late summer, 2013, at nearly four years of age, it's bright and fresh in black and red currants, mocha, licorice, baking spices and smoky sandalwood. But it's also quite tannic.

Expensive, yes, but it's right up there with Napa's best.",94,135,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

It's all Klipsun Vineyard fruit, 75% Merlot and 25% Cabernet, and its soft, chocolatey tannins envelope the taste buds in a sensual, textured landscape comprised of luscious cherry fruit and laced with hints of anise and roasted coffee. Big and extracted, yet more approachable than the Cabernet.",92,60,Washington,Washington,Merlot
US,"This extroverted wine brims with toasted oak, chocolate and smoke aromas, followed by ripe, jammy fruit flavors. With full body and a velvety texture of soft tannins, it's both smooth and tongue-gripping at the same time.",90,26,California,Amador County,Primitivo
US,"This exudes classic Chardonnay richness. Pure and heady, it explodes with tropical fruit and orange essences, with buttered toast and vanilla flavors from oak barrels and lees contact. Zesty Russian River acidity kicks in to provide perfect balance. The creaminess is delicious, suggesting shellfish in a buttery sauce.",93,74,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
US,"This fabulous Cabernet has been blended with Merlot, Cab Franc and Petit Verdot. It's incredibly complex in both flavor and structure, offering waves of blackberries and cherries, currants, dark chocolate and toast that go on and on into a long, spicy finish. The grapes come from various sources, including St. Helena and Atlas Peak, showing winemaker Tom Hinde's mastery of the art of blending.",95,150,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This fabulous vintage offered all sorts of possibilities. The winery chose an austere route. Tightly controlled blackberry and cassis notes are wrapped in oak, and the wine is very dry. It may age. If you drink it now, do so with the richest beef or lamb you can find. ‚ÄîS.H.",87,40,California,Northern Sonoma,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This falls sbetween a ros√© and an orange wine in its appearance, a pale salmon/copper shade that results from 36 hours of skin contact before pressing. Scents of hibiscus tea and rosewater put a delicate top note ahead of rich, ripe, round and spicy citrus fruit. A strong impression of cinnamon marks the finish.",90,28,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"This family-owned winery comes out swinging with this blend of 81% Zinfandel backed by bits of Grenache, Petite Sirah and Syrah, casting aromas of boysenberry, cola and freshly cut grilled rib eye. On the palate, it's smooth and evenly balanced with blackberry pie, vanilla and milk chocolate, offering the perfect partner for barbecued ribs and flame-broiled steak.",91,52,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
US,"This fascinating Chardonnay combines elegance with the opulence you expect from California. It's ripe and forward in papaya, quince, mango, pear and pineapple fruits, but also shows a steely minerality that's as fresh and pure as snowmelt water in a pebbly stream. It is never forward or over-the-top.",93,35,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay

US,"This fine marriage of site and winemaker shows experience and intuition at work, presenting a full-bodied, lush and plush expression of tremendous depth and complexity. It offers notes of tart apple, licorice and a wealth of orange zest, which adds a touch of citrusy crispness to the naturally buoyant minerality and nuanced oak. It has much more to share; drink now through 2020.",95,65,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"This fine-honed Chardonnay hews to the Eyrie house style. It may seem austere at first, but the green and yellow fruit flavors are ripe, not vegetal, and the firm acidity makes it a fine food match. Give it plenty of time to breathe before serving.",88,27,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Chardonnay
US,"This five grape Bordeaux-style blend has a sharp, spicy aroma, a strong suggestion of clove. The fruit is quite light and tastes of strawberries, but quickly is overtaken by the tannins and the barrel flavors. Drink soon.",85,29,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"This five-vineyard blend of Chard has superripe, possibly botrytised, flavors of apricots and new oak. It's almost late-harvest in style, although it's fully dry. A disappointment.",84,32,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"This flagship effort showcases the winery's oldest block of Cabernet, planted in 1975‚Äîthe first vineyard on Red Mountain. The subtle, slightly grainy and grassy nuances of old-vine grapes are here, with red-fruit flavors that are soft and delicate, yet substantial. There's a light dusting of cinnamon, a whiff of smoke and an over-riding elegance. Such old vine, 100% Red Mountain Cabernet from a great vintage doesn't come along very often.",93,65,Washington,Red Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This flinty Chardonnay shares a full oak expression with a whiff of petrol, suggesting a decant or cellaring until 2016 to fully soften. It offers sublime lemon curd and minerally peach flavor amid tangy acidity and a bright finish. It displays a ying-yang between polish and power.",94,50,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay

US,"This fresh, leesy, almost creamy young Riesling is the first release from this new Walla Walla start-up.

The ripeness turns the lemony fruit into limoncello, and the finish is long and wonderfully refreshing.",92,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sauvignon Blanc
US,"This fruit-driven Pinot Gris blends green apple, melon and pear, with a hint of celery suggesting some less-than-ripe fruit in the mix also. The finish turns a little bitter.",86,13,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"This fruity and full-bodied wine offers much to like. The opposite of crisp and lively, it was made in an unabashedly ripe and rich style. Pear and butter aromas lead to ripe peach and vanilla flavors. The texture is rich in the mouth and the finish is soft.",87,11,California,California,Chardonnay
US,"This fruity wine is a sugary mix of bubble gum, mint and syrupy peaches. It consists of bold flavors, but lacks the delicacy that Riesling can show in many vintages.",85,14,Washington,Yakima Valley,Riesling

US,"This full-bodied blend of grapes from a wide assortment of top vineyards shows fine acidity, a good phenolic frame of citrus rind, and core flavors of lemon and grapefruit, green apple and white peach.

US,"This full-bodied blockbuster strikes a good balance between very ripe, lavish fruit aromas and spicy oak and berry flavors and a sense of good structure. It has gobs of strawberry and mulberry, a light and lively texture despite the high alcohol, and lingering, almost sweet finish.",87,26,California,Livermore Valley,Zinfandel

US,"This full-bodied wine relies more on its rich texture and nutty, mineral flavors than on the usual citrus and herb notes, so it's rather thick in profile. It has the heft of a Chardonnay and savory, almond-like accents that are worth appreciating.",87,15,California,California,Sauvignon Blanc

US,"This full-bodied, concentrated wine shows plenty of power in its bringing together of the variety with smaller percentages of Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Malbec. With a huge presence on the palate that lingers and stays in one's brain, it shows a reductive quality of toasted oak along with black pepper, bark and leather saddle,. It's a wine to enjoy from a giant leather chaise, if possible. Cellar until 2023.",95,85,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This generous and full-bodied wine made in partnership with country singer Zac Brown has ripe fruit and sweet-seeming spice aromas that continue into the flavors, softening its gentle, already mild tannic texture. While previous vintages were from the North Coast region, this one carries the broader California appellation.",89,20,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This gets the award for the most confusing label of the month. It says Vigil ‚ÄúTradicion‚Äù and also names the vineyard, then writes Mokelumne River Old Vines, and finishes with Lodi.

US,"This gets the Cabernet basics done, with ripe, jammy blackberry and cherry flavors, full-bodied tannins and a dry, spicy finish. It's a good everyday Cab, and the bag-in-box packaging means you don't have to rush to finish it.",84,23,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This gigantic Cabernet is not showing well now. The tannins are too strong, the fruit too fresh, sweet and direct in blackberries and cherries, the oak too unintegrated with everything else. It's like a bowl of ingredients that need to be cooked into a recipe. But the structure of tannins and acids is just fine, and while the alcohol is on the high side, the heat it gives is balanced into the overall mouthfeel. Give it 6‚Äì8 years to begin to come around.",92,80,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This good, basic wine offers herb and cherry aromas, mostly crisp fruit flavors and a firm, tannic texture.",85,12,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This grabs attention quickly, with a dark color and potent jam and brown sugar aromas. Next come dazzling strawberry syrup flavors backed by thick tannins and good acidity. The texture is astringent and tight, but the flavors are so full that they meet the tannins half way. Best now through 2019.",90,15,California,Lodi,Zinfandel
US,"This grape can be styled as super acidic or tropically lush, and this version leans to the latter.

US,"This great-value SB from Lake County hits it out of the park on all sorts of fronts, including price.

Best Buy.",87,10,California,Lake County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"This Grenache-based wine includes 10% Tempranillo, 4% Malbec and 2% Syrah in the sophisticated blend. Recently bottled, it's still tight, tannic, and hiding much of its fruit. The aromas give an indication of what's to come‚Äîcranberry fruit and lemony acidity, with some firm tannins.",87,22,Oregon,Southern Oregon,Garnacha

US,"This Guerneville-area estate is one of the last picked by the producer, and it delivers enviable depth and complexity. Highlights include a dollop of apricot jam beside rich honeycomb and toasty oak. Juicy acidity supports its creamy tendency toward tropical flavor, as streaks of citrus fiercely protect its freshness.",94,65,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This hails from a 1,000‚Äì1,400-foot elevation site above the valley floor called Oakville Ranch that contributes beautiful power in its firm, integrated tannin and oak. Balanced, the wine exudes lovely notes of boysenberry tart, blackberry and cedar, with a dusting of clove.",92,69,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon

Dry and food-friendly, this has class.",84,24,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc

US,"This has a brighter yellow color than most of its peers, more body, riper fruit flavors and‚Äîunusual for this variety in America‚Äîprobably some oak influence. Rather full bodied, but well-balanced and very smooth, it combines peach and pear flavors with a hefty mouthfeel.",91,25,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Gris

US,"This has a gorgeous nose redolent with dried spices and hints of incense. The moderate (13.8%) alcohol is a joy, and the use of oak (half new) is just right.

US,"This has a vibrant yellow-gold color and aromas like fresh herbs and sliced celery. Almost electric acidity pulses in the crisp grapefruit, lime and melon flavors that lead to a lingering finish. The vivid freshness and tangy texture sets it apart from the crowd, and it will work wonderfully with foods from raw oysters to roast chicken.",91,18,California,North Coast,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"This has a vivid, gold color with just a touch of pink, which makes sense considering Pinot Gris is not really a white wine grape, but a gris or gray shade in between blanc and noir. Aromas are like buttered popcorn, toasted almond and a touch of honey. It is undeniably flavorful, lush in texture and full bodied. The blend is 75% Pinot Gris and 25% Pinot Blanc.",90,24,California,California,Pinot Gris
US,"This has all of the easygoing, good raspberry and blueberry flavors that a Cabernet Franc should.

US,"This has light but sweet fruit flavor, leaning heavily toward strawberry and Bing cherry candy. The fruit is a bit mismatched to the tannins, which are thick and chewy, but with additional bottle age the middle may fill out somewhat.

Earthy and somewhat austere, the wine is a blend of cassis and green pepper.",84,47,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This herbaceous wine has aromas like snap peas and flavors like fruit cocktail, white pepper and celery. Light to medium in body, it offers good acidity.",85,18,California,North Coast,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"This herbal, lightly earthy wine coveys aromas like thyme and parsley, but takes several minutes to open up. Flavors are subtle and citrusy and the texture smooth, with medium body.",87,18,California,Lake County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"This hides its 37 g/L residual sugar with bracing acidity and overall complexity. A dense run of ripe fruits‚ÄîMeyer lemon, sweet pineapple, orange, tangerine and papaya‚Äîcarries an interesting black tea note. The sweetness is detailed and complex, with honey and ginger candy flavors.",94,22,Washington,Yakima Valley,Riesling
US,"This high-acid Chardonnay has a prickly mouthfeel. It tastes considerably more tart than almost anything out there, which at least makes it different. Other than that, it offers fairly standard flavors of peaches, citrus fruits and pears, with oak elaborations.",85,18,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This high-alcohol mountain Zin seems to have already lost its zip, dominated by a raisiny overripeness that skirts dangerously into syrup land.",83,28,California,Amador County,Zinfandel
US,This highly aromatic Sauvignon Blanc dishes out loads of pretty white peach and yellow cherry flavors backed by a bristling streak of acidity. It's a vibrant yet satisfyingly full-bodied wine with a pristine grapefruit finish. Drink now through 2020.,90,22,New York,Finger Lakes,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"This high-octane wine will please lovers of big, powerful Zinfandel. It's a little hot from high alcohol, but so lush, you hardly notice. Offers waves of currants, anise and pepper that go on and on, and the finish is dry.",89,41,California,Howell Mountain,Zinfandel
US,"This high-toned, lovely wine is a best-of blend from several vineyards‚Äîprimarily Ritchie and Banfield. Sugar pie apple and fig flavors form a robustly concentrated fruitiness that's ribbed with vibrant minerality. A clarified butter-like creaminess comes through on the finish.",96,54,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This hits it right in the sweet spot for Chardonnay-loving consumers, with buttered toast, honey and grilled pineapple flavors. It's part of Delicato Family Vineyards' Noble Vines series.",85,13,California,Monterey,Chardonnay
US,"This hits the palate rather hard and green, with thin fruit that does not seem quite ripe. The barrel flavors add fat and caramel over the top, but remain unintegrated and seem out of place. The wine reverts to its green side as the tannins take over.",84,24,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"This holds two-thirds Cabernet Sauvignon with the rest Merlot and a splash of Petit Verdot. Oak aromas of butterscotch, woodspice and vanilla are out in front of cherry and herbs. On the palate, the oak flavors lead, followed by coffee and cherry. It seems a bit heavy-handed right now but may come together with time.",89,35,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"This homage to Chablis blends fruit from Bentrock (49%), Rita's Crown (22%), Zotovich (14%), Kessler-Haak (8%), Clos Pepe (3%), Esperanza (3%) and Radian (1%) vineyards, delivering tight aromas of yellow flowers and grilled peach. It dances across the tongue with playful, squeezed lemon acidity, showing crushed white rocks and baking soda minerality, and finishing its high tones on a grapefruit pith bitterness.",89,40,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"This huge, rich Zinfandel is ripe‚Äînearly overripe‚Äîwith dry raisin, blackberry and currant flavors. There's a curious bitterness to the finish that must come from the shriveled grape skins, which add to the wine's complexity. The vineyard is on the cooler, hillier western side of Paso Robles. Not a Zin for everyone, it's nevertheless a classic example of its genre.",91,35,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
US,"This hugely ripe Chardonnay is just a little too big for absolute balance. Any more powerful, and it would be over the line. As it is, it flirts with it, with gobs of jammy apricots, yellow pears, citrine and Meyer lemondrop, as well as barrel influences ranging from creamy lees to buttered toast, roasted hazelnuts and smoky honey. The alcohol is over 15%.",89,46,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This immensely likeable wine, from the Oak Knoll section of the valley, avoids the overly fat, soft fruit of warmer areas, while preserving vital acidity. There's plenty of cassis fruit, and 50% new oak, but it's wonderfully balanced, with a modest 13.5% alcohol. You might easily mistake it for a fine St.-Julien, it's that good.",93,30,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This impressive 100% varietal wine comes from Cold Creek, Candy Mountain and Windrow vineyards. With the oak (40% new French) pleasantly restrained, it offers aromas of dried herbs, coffee, cherry and light barrel spices. Lithe black currant flavors are tightly focused and flavorful with taut acidity, showing exceptional length and balance. Best from 2018 to 2023.",93,50,Washington,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This impressive 100% varietal wine shows focused red fruit, a tropical edge of coconut and firm, structured tannin. Sage, cedar, tobacco and black pepper notes provide a sultry, savory counterpoint to the fruit, balanced with moderate acidity. Enjoy 2023‚Äì2033.",94,155,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This impressive wine dances in hearty clove and cinnamon sparked by a floral bouquet of rose. High-toned, structured and elegant, it has subtle power and concentration but remains fresh in the glass. Drink now through 2020.",92,45,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This impressive wine from estate-grown fruit, including 10% Cabernet Franc, is tightly woven, fleshy and youthful, with smoky cedar and dark cherry notes. Powerfully structured, it shows a classic approach to ripeness and oak, integrating both well and with restraint.",90,80,California,Coombsville,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This impressive wine is succulent in delicious berry flavor that's been dipped in smoky leather. Supple firm tannin adds structure and strength, as a length of spice and tobacco plays palatable games on the finish.",90,24,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
US,"This impressively textured, focused and voluptuous wine offers well-defined flavors and aromas of honey, caramel and crisp Golden Delicious apple. Seamless and well balanced, it impresses from start to finish, with buoyant, supportive acidity at its core.",93,48,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This inaugural release from former NFL quarterbacks Dan Marino and Damon Huard is a blend of 86% Discovery Cabernet Sauvignon, 9% Klipsun Merlot and 5% Champoux Cabernet Franc. It's aromatically brooding at kickoff, with notes of dark coffee, dusty earth and cherry. The soft, smooth cherry and coffee flavors will benefit from additional time in the bottle, as this wine is more about elegance than sheer power. Give it until 2025‚Äì2030 to see it at its best; it has the stuffing to get there.",93,75,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This inaugural release is 100% varietal that's aged in neutral French puncheons. The panoply of notes includes raspberry seed, dark plum, green olive and nori. The mouthfeel is the true star with a rich, pillowy-soft, palate-coating texture showing exceptional purity and an extended finish.",93,45,Washington,Yakima Valley,Grenache
US,This inexpensive Pinot Gris has pear fruit with spicy highlights that somehow conjure up caraway. It's wrapped in yeasty flavors of fresh-baked bread and plenty of lemony acid.,86,15,Oregon,Oregon,Pinot Gris
US,"This inky-black Bordeaux blend is based on Cabernet Sauvignon. It's bone dry, tremendously hard in tannins and also quite acidic, giving the overall impression of tough rusticity. However, there's a tremendous core of blackberries and cassis. Decant and drink now.",86,22,California,Paicines,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"This insanely sippable wine is ready for spring oyster gatherings or gulping down on its own. Low in alcohol with just 6 g/L residual sugar, it's crisp, deliciously light and yet mouth-filling in tropical fruit and peach. Another masterful Chenin from Dry Creek Vineyard.",89,12,California,Clarksburg,Chenin Blanc
US,"This intensely aromatic, off-dry Riesling jumps from the glass with a heady bouquet of flowers and tropical fruit. On the palate, flavors of peach and blossom are highlighted with brisk lemon-lime acidity. Pretty and pleasing, it finishes with a lacy sweetness and just a hint of fresh herbs.",87,17,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Riesling
US,"This interesting Cabernet was grown in various parts of the valley, but you can detect a cool-climate influence in the acidity and especially the tannins, which are firm and astringent. Yet the wine, which contains small amounts of Merlot and Cabernet Franc, is remarkably ripe in blackberries, cherries and currants. Shows lots of elegance and complexity. Drink it over the next six years.",91,45,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This intriguing wine features herb, lemon twist, tobacco and spice aromas. The blue fruit flavors are lush in feel, with fine-grained tannins.",89,40,Washington,Yakima Valley,Tempranillo
US,"This introduces itself with sweet scents of plum and cherry, the sort found in young vines. It moves into a thick, well-structured midpalate, with big splashes of coffee, earth and roasted nut.",92,50,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, all estate grown. Winemaker Steve Clifton handles the high (over 15%) alcohol well, and the wine feels full and balanced, but not fat or tiring. The fruit is a pleasant mix of raspberry, cherry and currant; with bright acids and firm tannins to back it up.",89,32,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, although it doesn't say so on the label. The wine is awesome and impeccable in the modern Oakville style of intensely ripe fruit and sweet, soft tannins. The flavors of raspberries, cherries, cocoa and sweet oak are incredibly delicious. It's soft enough to drink now, but will hold for 6‚Äì8 years.",93,150,California,Oakville,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"This is 100% Malbec, so inky it is black in color. The flavors echo the color, with amazing density. Black fruits, black olives, smoke and spice are structured around thick tannins. A minute-plus finish adds licorice and mint; even after being opened for a full 48 hours this wine remained fresh and balanced. It's the first varietal Malbec ever from Walla Walla Vintners, but certainly one hopes it is not the last.",92,30,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Malbec
US,"This is 100% Riesling, and the intense, floral aromas suggest a smattering of Gew√ºrztraminer, at least in essence if not in fact. Beeswax, lemon candy, orange blossom and other juicy citrus components swirl around the palate, making this an exceptionally complex and beguiling wine. Though labeled dry, it carries an impression of fruit sweetness, rather than the bracing minerality of some other dry Rieslings. A wine that is almost Germanic in its attack, and a truly lovely bottle.",91,20,Washington,Yakima Valley,Riesling
US,"This is 100% Riesling, but with less than half the residual sugar of the winery's 2011 vintage. Sourced from the Evergreen Vineyard in the up-and-coming Ancient Lakes AVA, it has great acidity and purity of fruit, along with the minerality for which the region is known. Dense flavors of lime, grapefruit and pineapple are at the core of this wonderfully concentrated, expressive Riesling.",93,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling

US,"This is 100% varietal with the fruit coming from Ciel du Cheval, Red Willow and Phinny Hill vineyards. Expressive but still wound-up aromas of exotic spice, French oak, chocolate and dark fruit are followed by pitch-black fruit flavors and tightly wound tannins. It's not yet ready to fully reveal its charms but has the stuffing to go the distance.",91,65,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is 100% varietal, tart to the edge of sour, with no sign of new oak. The fruit dances around rhubarb and sour cherry, with some green tannins.",84,16,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Barbera
US,"This is 100% varietal, with a mix of vineyard sources including Champoux, Weinbau, Conner Lee and Dineen. It's a carefully crafted blend of different AVAs; a bright and clean example of Washington state Cabernet. Firm, compact, with blue and purple fruits, just a hint of barrel age and polished tannins.",89,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is 100% varietal. It has muscle and mass, with tart purple and black fruits wrapped into layers of earth and slightly metallic tannins. There is a green streak but it adds complexity and is not off-putting. This would be an excellent wine with a simple hanger steak.",87,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"This is 100% Viognier, different from the winery's varietally labeled version in that it is 100% stainless-steel fermented. The result is a less round and toasty wine, but one that, in this vintage at least, offers more focus and precision. Peach and apricot, tangerine and tropical fruits are on display, and the finish winds down gently, with none of the heat or bitterness that can affect some Viogniers.",90,18,Washington,Washington,Viognier
US,"This is 75% Merlot, with Cabernet, Malbec and Syrah comprising the other 25%. Despite all of the components, it tastes like there is a bit of a hole. The fruit is soft and plummy, and the overall balance is excellent.",88,45,Washington,Red Mountain,Merlot
US,"This is 80% Cabernet Sauvignon blended with 16% Merlot and 4% Cabernet Franc. It shows a nice interplay of fruit and barrel with notes of cocoa, cherry, dry chocolate and toast supported by well-integrated tannins. The mid-palate still needs some time to fully come together but when it does, it will be a beauty.",91,40,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is 89% Cabernet Sauvignon, 8% Merlot and 3% Syrah. It's toasty to the max, with scents and flavors of coffee and smoke as much as berry and cassis. There is great acid/tannin balance and some additional years of bottle age should help to bring out more of the fruit.",90,45,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is 96% Cabernet Sauvignon, with an addition of Syrah. Fully ripe, bold and assertive, this high-octane wine holds its alcohol well. Muscular and powerful, it has black cherry and cassis flavors that saturated with baking spice, chocolate, cedar and coffee notes. This is well supported by acids and is matched to perfectly ripe tannins.",91,45,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is a 100% Cabernet, and its tannins are so strong that it's virtually undrinkable now. It displays class in every way, with an intense concentration of cassis liqueur and blackberry that's especially deep in the middle palate, but it also persists into a long, spicy finish. It would be a pity to open it before 2018, and it has the structure to go the long haul.",94,145,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is a 100% varietal selection, with most of the fruit coming from Weinbau Vineyard.

US,"This is a barrel selection, presumably limited in cases. It's an extraordinarily rich, concentrated 100% Cabernet Sauvignon, made in the modern cult-style of massively extracted blackberries, black currants, cassis liqueur and chocolate, with oak bringing the usual sweet toast and vanilla complexities. This deserves its high score for sheer opulence and great Napa structure. Delicious now, and could easily age for at least 10 years.",94,150,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is a beautiful Cabernet Sauvignon. It epitomizes the Napa quality of power married to finesse.

US,"This is a beautiful Riesling. It's not totally dry, like the label says, because there's a vein of honey that enriches the orange, apricot and white flower flavors, and persists into the finish.

Delicious now and through 2014.",87,22,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is a big, powerful Bordeaux blend that clearly needs time. Tasted in early 2009, it's very tannic and dry, although you can detect the massive cassis and plum flavors.

Delicious as it is, it's all primary fruit now. Give it 2‚Äì3 years to mellow.",92,65,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is a big, tannic and dry Cabernet, but it's very elegant, and shows the pedigree of Alexander Valley at its best. Impeccably balanced in acidity and tannins, the fruit is pure blackberries and black currants, with a wonderful earthiness suggesting dried sage and thyme. Should develop nicely over the next 6‚Äì8 years.",91,47,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is a big, tannic, midnight black Cabernet, rude in youth and barely drinkable. The tannins are powerful enough to lock down the palate. The grapes, grown in Calistoga, are very ripe in blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, but those tannins are stubbornly astringent. Almost old-fashioned in toughness despite very high alcohol, it's a curiosity that seems likely to develop in the cellar, but with so little evidence of past vintages, all bets are off.",91,125,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is a bit lighter than the previous vintage, offering tart red-berry fruit, accented with a note of fresh herb. The chocolaty barrel accents smooth out the midpalate and lead into a pleasant finish.",87,24,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"This is a bit stinky right out of the bottle, with some sour, rotten egg aromas. Ultimately they blow off, but there's still a palate impression of sulfur and burnt match. The net effect is to put a damper on the fruit, which pokes through the sulfurous fog tasting rather soapy and limpid.",82,12,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling

US,"This is a blend from several vineyard sites, including Banfield, Saitone, Carlisle, Montafi and Papera, each boasting more than 100-year-old vines.

US,"This is a blend of Testarossa's far-flung vineyards across California, hence the statewide appellation. It's extraordinarily rich and explosive in apricots, pineapples, guavas, nectarines, buttered toast and smoky, caramelized oak. So muscular that you might want to age it for a year or two, to let it calm down.",92,55,California,California,Chardonnay

This is a tasty bottle ready to enjoy immediately.",89,36,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"This is a Bordeaux-style blend, 60% Cabernet Sauvignon, with Cabernet Franc and Merlot filling it out. All the fruit comes from the Stillwater Creek Vineyard. The initial aromas are dominated with sweet, toasty, pretty new French oak, with the irresistible flavors of mocha following. As good as it is, the fruit seems light and submerged, with little depth. This is a wine to enjoy in its youth.",89,43,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"This is a buttery style of Chardonnay, but done deliciously. Aromas of clotted cream, browned butter, vanilla custard, sea-salt caramel, roasted almonds and cashews meet with fresh lemon and apple-blossom touches on the chalky nose. The palate is very grippy with Meyer lemon and lime pith, but then reveals creamy flavors of clarified butter on toast.",93,42,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay

It's full-bodied and very ripe, with berry-cherry flavors that have a baked, pie-filling warmth, and additional layers of olive tapenade and salted, dried beef. The finish includes Zin's savory wealth of peppery spices.",87,34,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel
US,"This is a good, dry Chardonnay, marked by brisk acidity and a steely minerality. The fruit veers toward pineapples and apricots, while oak adds notes of buttered toast and caramel. Feels like it wants to be richer than it is, but it's elegant.",87,38,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
US,"This is a good, dry, somewhat rugged Cabernet, rich in varietal blackberry and black currant flavors with a coating of smoky oak. It's fully ready to drink now. Shows real elegance in the refined mouthfeel, and the spicy finish is a delight.",87,25,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is a good, full-bodied, dry Cabernet that delivers with plenty of varietal personality.

Easy to find, with 12,000 cases produced.",88,35,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is a good, if somewhat soft and simple wine, with blackberry, cola and oak flavors. Structurally lean, the palate longs for something to grip onto and doesn't find it.",86,75,California,Calistoga,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is a good, rich, complex Cab, but it's also toughly tannic, and needs time in the cellar to come around. Beneath the astringency are ripe flavors of blackberries, cherries and sweet fresh herbs. Give it until 2011, if you can.",91,60,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is a good, solid wine labeled to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Parducci estate. It has robust flavors, full body and a rich layer of tannins to add texture.

US,"This is a gorgeous Cabernet, but it's pretty young, and while it's delicious now due to the ripe fruit, it really needs time. Wrapped in fresh, tight tannins, it displays powerful red and black currant, blackberry, cherry, chocolate and vanilla oak flavors, and shows the elegant, important mouthfeel of a top Napa Cab. Give it until after 2008, if you can keep your hands off, and will come into its own after 2010.",93,75,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is a great example of what most would consider a straight-ahead and delicious California Chardonnay. The nose offers aromas of seared pineapple cake, vanilla soda and Meyer lemon, and the palate blends all of the typical elements: lemon juice acidity down the middle, minerality driven by slate and white rocks, apple and a bit of brown spice on the edges.",92,25,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"This is a great Merlot that's intensely concentrated and dazzlingly rich‚Äîeverything you want a Merlot to be.

US,"This is a great vineyard that has sourced great Cabs for Terra Valentine. A barrel sample of the '04, tasted more than 2 years ago, showed ageability. Now that it has been released, the wine is still very young and filled with potential. Thick in black currants, cherries and oak, it needs much more time. Best after 2010.",92,58,California,Spring Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is a limited production 100% Cab from the winery's estate vineyard. It's much more tannic than Cohn's extraordinarily fine '04 Estate, which was released a year ago. Even at the age of five-plus, it stings with sandpapery astringency. Should easily negotiate the years, with its massive core of blackberries, black currants, olives and 100% new oak. Hold until after 2010, and should develop for many years beyond.",93,100,California,Sonoma Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is a limited-production offering from a tiny appellation, blended with small amounts of Cabernet Franc, Malbec and Petit Verdot.

US,"This is a mix of 56% Sagemoor and 41% Champoux Cabernet, with a 3% splash of estate Petit Verdot. It's detailed in the manner of a Pauillac, thick cassis fruit with deep veins of iron, cedar, licorice and a just a hint of silage. The fruit is dark and dense, but with breathing you'll find it begins to open into a splendid blend of black cherry, cassis and mountain berry flavor. Woodward Canyon's red wines age beautifully, but if drunk young give them a lot of breathing time.",94,84,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is a muscular Merlot, exotic in cinnamon/cardamom spice that's otherwise soft, structured and complex. The tannins are most pronounced on the finish and need time to further integrate, but make the wine long-lasting in leathery cassis and tobacco flavor.",89,35,California,Livermore Valley,Merlot
US,"This is a neutral, papery white wine, with a flat, rather than lively mouthfeel. The apple flavored fruit is there, along with a touch of licorice, but the freshness seems to have been lost along the way.",85,18,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"This is a new dessert wine from Bonny Doon, from the Arroyo Seco region which is such a great source of whites. With 11% residual sugar, it's quite sweet. The apricot, peach, pear and lime flavors have a honeyed, botrytised richness.",87,30,California,Arroyo Seco,Roussanne
US,"This is a new label for King Vintners, a new division of King Estate. The wine takes an herbal path rather than putting the emphasis on juicy fruit. A phenolic edge frames the finish.

US,"This is a new project from the Bundschu family of Gundlach Bundschu, a chance to highlight some high-quality fruit from the new Moon Mountain AVA.

US,"This is a new wine from Agustin Huneeus, of Quintessa. It's made largely from grapes off the Rutherford estate, and contains one-quarter S√©millon.

US,"This is a one-of-a-kind wine in the state, with 50% of the wine fermented on skins for nine months and the rest aged in concrete and older oak. Pure red- and blue-fruit aromas are followed by bold fruit flavors and well-integrated tannins, without a trace of oak in sight. It's a completely unique interpretation of the variety, but most importantly, it's delicious.",90,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is a perfectly drinkable wine, with good fruit from a great vineyard. It's a bit minty and chalky; let's say rustic. The mixed flavors border on the lightly vegetal side of cool-climate fruit; not sweet but firm.",86,25,Washington,Red Mountain,Sangiovese
US,"This is a pert, pretty Cabernet Franc fragrant of Maraschino liqueur, sage and tarragon. It's forward in oak with wide swathes of toast and char, but elegantly balanced with crisp blackberry and black cherry flavors. Finishes with a murmur of soft tannins.",87,22,New York,Seneca Lake,Cabernet Franc

US,"This is a powdery, pillowy and richly lush wine that flirts with voluptuous tendencies of soft, juicy red fruit, yet offers pretty floral elements and complex seasonings of cinnamon and nutmeg on the nose. At the same time, the underlying grip provides structure and depth. Decant or hold through 2022.",94,110,California,St. Helena,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is a powerful Chardonnay. It's explosive in tropical fruit, in malic acids and in new charred oak. All the parts kind of stick out on their own, going in different directions. It's a good New World style, but it should have more synergy.",85,26,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
US,"This is a powerful wine, with intense scents of pineapple leading a lively interplay of citrus, stone, Asian pear and spices. Thrilling texture, balance and length make this a standout, even in this outstanding vintage for all Pinot Gris.",93,19,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"This is a pretty basic Zin, fresh and tart in blackberry jam flavor. In its favor, it displays robust full-bodiedness and plenty of Zinny spices. At this price, it's fine with burgers, tacos, ribs.",84,8,California,California,Zinfandel
US,"This is a pretty eastern U.S. Merlot, with its subtle, nuanced flavors of red berry, plum and currant and its approachable, soft tannins. Virginia is showing its talent for growing reds and this is a good example of what can be done with good vineyard management and winemaking.",85,18,Virginia,Monticello,Merlot

US,"This is a promising wine from a Los Angeles County vineyard. Bolstered by 10% Cabernet Sauvignon and 5% Merlot, it shows dried cherries, coffee syrup, crushed bricks, deep tobacco, leather and sliced-steak notes on the nose. The mouthfeel is full and boisterous with acidity, conveying red cherry and tangy cranberry. An earthy and floral aspect emerges on the finish.",88,26,California,South Coast,Sangiovese

US,"This is a successful straight-ahead Chardonnay, with aromas of buttercream, vanilla and orange cake developing complexity thanks to alkaline, pithy notes.

US,"This is a superb Cab at this price and case production level, tasting like one much smaller in production. With hearty tannins, it offers nuanced cranberry fruit and notable acidity, full body and a finish combining black olive and tobacco.

US,"This is a sweetly gentle, attractive wine for drinking now with steak, lamb chops or any meat with a smoky, charred edge.

It gains mass and breadth as it breathes.",92,50,Washington,Red Mountain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"This is a tight, dry, tannic wine, showing all the hallmarks of ageabiity. Winemaker Philippe Melka has done a good job of blending fruit from Yountville, Atlas Peak and St. Helena to produce a seamlessly integrated Cabernet. The mouthfeel is soft, yet with fierce tannins that frame superb blackberry, cocoa, herb, mineral and cedar flavors. This continues a string of successful Cabernets that have been modestly priced, by Napa standards. Hold until 2018, at the very least.",93,60,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is a tough wine in two ways. It's rather hard and brittle in acids and tannins now, and it's also tough to predict its future. It's rich in currant, blackberry jam, coffee and cedar flavors, but there is an undertow of raisins that could compromise its longterm viability.",88,70,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is a tough, chewy Merlot, a bit of a stylistic departure for Walla Walla Vintners. Perhaps it's the addition of Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, or perhaps just the result of the challenging 2010 vintage in the Walla Walla Valley. But the greenish tannins bring a lot of herbal flavors to the forefront, and tend to bury the fruit.",87,28,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot

US,"This is a true pan-Washington Cabernet, with fruit coming from 12 different vineyards scattered across the Columbia Valley. It's 100% varietal as aromas of char, toast, black cherry meats, herb, cranberry and spice are followed by elegantly styled dark-fruit flavors. The tannins bring a bit of heft and grip.",89,30,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is a unique and exciting take on California's historic grape from one of the region's pioneering wineries. Aromas recall sour cranberry, orange peel, strawberry and sagebrush.

US,"This is a very approachable and tasty wine, especially for a grape that can be so tannic when young. Aromas of cola, chopped mint and cherries translate to a fruity and minty palate, with just enough tannins, a nice acidic spice and a bit of woodiness on the finish. It's very well measured.",92,42,California,Paso Robles,Tempranillo
US,"This is a very big, extractedly fruity Bordeaux blend. Right now, it's tannic and sharp and dry, but it has explosive blackberry, black currant and dark chocolate flavors. Rather too angular and awkward for complete enjoyment, but cellar for 4‚Äì6 years and try again.",88,65,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"This is a very complete, well-balanced and satisfying wine that has a firm tannic structure to carry the tempting berry and black-cherry flavors. It starts with light cinnamon, clove and vanilla aromas that join loads of fruit on the palate, layering nicely for an interesting, complex and substantive character. Drink through 2025.",93,24,California,El Dorado,Zinfandel

US,"This is a very fairly priced Cabernet given its quality. It's made from 100% Cab and all estate grown in the high elevations of Fair Play in El Dorado County.

US,"This is a very fine expression of Viognier, showing an intensity of flavors, but maintaining balance, elegance, and a dry profile. Waves of honeysuckle, oranges, limes, pears and oak are offset by minerality and acidity. Richly extracted, it will pair well with scallop, lobster and crab entr√©es.",91,32,California,Russian River Valley,Viognier
US,"This is a very flamboyant Chardonnay. The grapes are superripe in pie-filling pineapples, nectarines and oranges, enhanced with smoky oak and sweet buttered popcorn, but the finish is completely dry. Drink now with rich fare, like lobster and shellfish.",91,25,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is a very good Cabernet, dry, full-bodied and rich in black currants. But it's not the Landslide of the early and mid-2000s. The vineyard, in the southern Alexander Valley, remains the same, but the wine just doesn't show the incredible aromatics and complexities of, say, the 2001, 2003 and 2005. Let's hope it's a temporary lapse.",88,35,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is a very high alcohol wine, porty and fruity-sweet on the finish, with raisin, milk chocolate, caramel and mulberry flavors. It's made in a certain old-fashioned Paso style that calls for barbecue and a designated driver.",85,42,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
US,"This is a very low-production, best-of-barrels selection by the winemaker. It's an extremely tight young wine, austere and almost searing in acidity, with a yeasty taste from sur lies aging. If you're looking for opulent, immediately accessible Chardonnay, this isn't for you. But the wine has tantalizing hints of grilled pineapples and nectarines, and the powerful structure suggests cellaring. Stash this away for a couple of years.",93,45,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay

US,"This is a very ripe Chardonnay, with pineapple, orange and apricot jam flavors. It's rich but not particularly subtle, with lots of new French oak.",86,55,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"This is a very strong showing for a brand new brand, thanks, no doubt, to veteran winemaker Jeff Fink's involvement. Tight on the nose with Meyer lemon pith, savory salts and a waft of oak smoke, the palate explodes with chalky tension and rich yet bright complexity. Flavors of white lily, peach and sea salt ride atop melted butter, leading into a caramelized finish.",94,36,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is a very successful wine, made in the Paso style of soft voluptuousness and plenty of ripe, fruity flavors. Blended from the classic Bordeaux varieties, it's rich in blackberry and blueberry jam, buttered toast and spice flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Should develop over the next six years.",91,44,California,Paso Robles,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"This is a very summery bottling, with bright, fruity aromas recalling guava, peach, gardenia, pineapple and lemon-lime soda. That fruit salad aspect persists on the palate, but it's cut by a powerful burst of acidity, making it great for lakeside sipping.",89,22,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Grenache Blanc

US,"This is a vigorous young Cabernet, fresh and jammy in blackberry, cassis and new oak notes. The tannins are thick, smooth and flashy, and should protect the wine as it glides on its aging journey. Best after 2015.",92,44,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is a welcome return for this value Merlot after the 2004 vintage was skipped. The smooth and chocolaty flavors that consumers love are there, but they have been pulled back, letting more of the cherry fruit and subtle accents of forest floor, fungus and earth show through. It's textural, complex and thoroughly enjoyable.",89,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"This is a well-done effort from winemaker Riaan Rossouw, which shows how engaging, inviting and refined Merlot can be. Spiced red plum and red currant aromas seductively waft over dried fern and Mediterranean herb tones. Silky, soft tannins provide just enough structure to uphold the curvacious body of ripe red plum, sweet baking spice and additional dried herbs. Amazingly, this plush wine maintains excellent acidic verve, which carries along the entire medley of flavors to a persistent fruit-laden finish. Drink now for utter enjoyment.",91,20,Virginia,Monticello,Merlot
US,"This is a well-made wine at a more-than-fair price. Labeled varietally, it also holds smaller additions of other Bordeaux red grapes, most notably 6% Cabernet Franc. Black pepper, leather and cassis surround smoky oak and firm, integrated tannin, making for a complex, full-bodied and balanced experience.",91,24,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is a well-made wine from a specific site, seamless in full-bodied texture and sumptuous flavors of golden honey, baked apple and pear. Dottings of nutmeg provide additional punch and intrigue, while a lifted braid of acidity shines on the finish.",90,32,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is a well-made wine, supple and soft with velvety, integrated tannins and a relatively light body and sense of power. Chocolate and brown sugar play off of black cherry and cassis for a richness that never becomes cloying.",90,30,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is a wine that offers lots of class at a very good price. It's marked by flavors of streamlined citrus fruit, Asian pear, honey and a hint of buttered toast. It finishes thoroughly dry.

US,"This is a wine that's soft in structure, and while it's dry, it's hard in tannins and the fruit has a baked taste like shrivelled raisins. Not an ager.",84,35,California,Lake County,Zinfandel
US,"This is a wine the winery has lavished some extra care on:  barrel fermentation, 50% new oak, extra time in barrel. But the results are disappointing. A thin, sour wine, it has a bitter edge to it and a finish that suggests that something went wrong in the barrel.",81,20,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is a wonderful edition to Pearl, Sparkman's 100% Sauvignon Blanc. It's vibrant and energetic, the kind of high-wire flavors more commonly found in Sancerre. Three days after it was first tasted, the wine was still drinking beautifully, with candied mixed fruits and terrific concentration.",92,22,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sauvignon Blanc
US,"This is a wonderful wine that has the dry complexity and tannic structure of a great Napa red, with rich layers of cherries, red currants, mocha and sweet smoky oak. Yet it's supple, with a deft drinkability. A brilliant interpretation of the variety, it's hard to keep from popping the cork now, but should age well for 8‚Äì10 years.",94,150,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Franc
US,"This is a wonderful wine that's dryish and vital in acidity, with savory Meyer lemon, grapefruit, lemongrass, apricot and vanilla flavors. A touch of oak brings a buttered toast richness. Only 260 cases were produced.",90,20,California,Dry Creek Valley,Sauvignon Blanc

US,"This is a Zin that needs a warmer vintage to really succeed, and 2005 was cool. It trades the richness of the ‚Äò04 in favor of dried blackberry, tobacco, white pepper and herb flavors. The acid-tannin balance also is more notable. Quite good, but not great. Drink now.",87,20,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel
US,"This is actually a 2010 wine, but for consistency it is not labeled with the vintage.

US,"This is all Lewis Vineyard Cabernet, though not as strong as the vineyard-designated bottling from the same vintage. There is noticeable volatility in the opening aromas, which slowly blows off and turns into concentrated raspberry, boysenberry, plum and cherry compote fruit. Dense and buoyed with firm acids, this wine needs a full 24 hours to smooth out. There is plenty of well-managed oak, adding smoky coffee and espresso to the finish.",90,45,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is always a drily tannic wine in its youth, but it's also one of the most ambitious Cabs produced from Dry Creek Valley, and is worth attention. With a drop of Petit Verdot, it's young and jammy, explosive in black currant and chocolate flavors, with plenty of smoky oak. Although the tannins are big, they're completely ripe and sweet. Four-plus years of age have softened them. Drink this Cabernet Sauvignon now with very upscale foods, and it should hold and soften for a decade.",93,55,California,Dry Creek Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is an amazingly rich Cabernet, packed with classic Napa blackberry, blueberry and dark chocolate flavors. It's opulent even by California standards, and is a little sweet.

Could be one for the long haul.",92,75,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

The vineyard is Von Strasser's highest on the mountain, which maximally exposes it to the sun, and you can taste the solar ripeness in the intense essence of black currants and dark chocolate. The tannins exhibit classic Diamond Mountain potency. This is a dense Cabernet that needs serious time in the cellar. Hold until 2019, and it will continue to develop for many years afterward.",95,80,California,Diamond Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is an enormously rich Cabernet. It explodes in milk chocolate, black cherry, spicy plum and sweet, toasty oak flavors, wrapped into smooth tannins. Delicious, if a bit one-dimensional. Drink now.",87,65,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is an especially fine version of this single-vineyard Cabernet Franc; sadly, it may be awhile before we see it again as the vineyard suffered severe damage in 2011. Loaded with pure, rich cherry fruit, it adds layers of graphite, cedar and coffee over a mineral base.",91,28,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Cabernet Franc
US,"This is an everyday Chardonnay that's rich and ripe with honey, brown sugar, orange, lime and apricot flavors. It's creamy but balanced with tart acidity. An easygoing, straightforward wine.",84,15,California,Central Coast,Chardonnay
US,"This is an example of a lighter, drier style of Cabernet that maintains great elegance and charm. It's very dry, showing blackberry, black currant, herb and cedar flavors wrapped into firm tannins, and brightened with crispness. Best now‚Äì2011.",90,42,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is an excellent wine for the price. Aromas of lightly salted nectarines and pan-seared Asian pear are very inviting and pretty. There's a nice sizzle of acidity on the palate and a nervy tension, with lime juice and sea-salt sharpness leading into rounded almond and apple notes in the midpalate.",90,16,California,Central Coast,Chardonnay
US,"This is an excellent, deeply colored and moderately tannic wine with style. It follows its tamarind aromas with rich plum, prune and chocolate flavors, accented with mild vanilla and nutmeg notes.",89,28,California,Lake County,Sangiovese
US,"This is an expertly balanced wine from Temecula, showcasing region's potential for Grenache. Rosewater, cherry juice and cherry blossom aromas are lifted by herbal touches of marjoram and crushed peppercorn.

The cantaloupe flavors are broad and fleshy, lingering on the finish. It brings a lot of appeal.",89,25,Washington,Yakima Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is an extracted and dark style of Cab, showing tar, black pepper, espresso, deep purple fruit and loam on the nose. Baked black plum, elderberry and blackberry fruits show strongly on the palate, which is made deliciously complex by mocha, coffee syrup and cracked pepper accents. Mouthcoating tannins ensure a long cellar life; it should cellar well through 2034.",94,65,California,Paso Robles Willow Creek District,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is an exuberantly fruity, spicy and robust wine, speckled with 2% Petite Sirah. Dark and full of red berry flavor, the palate is dusted in brown sugar and black pepper. Ripe and concentrated, it drinks smooth and elegant despite its serious power.",90,36,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel
US,"This is an impressive bottling of well-distributed wine, blended with smaller percentages of all the major red Bordeaux varieties (plus 1% Tannat). Spicy clove, leather, cedar and herb hints highlight its subdued red fruit. The tannins are grippy and oak quite present, but both provide welcome structure and strength.",90,38,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is an impressively well-crafted, and beautiful wine, blended with 12% Cabernet Sauvignon and 10% Malbec, the main variety mountain-grown on Pritchard Hill. It shines in big, bold and powerfully built black fruit and leather. Dusty, firm tannins and a taste of graphite, coffee and tar are also highly evident. The finish is tart and seasoned in white pepper. Best enjoyed 2023 through 2033.",94,80,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Franc
US,"This is an inaugural release of this variety from the Mount George Vineyard in cool Coombsville, granted AVA status in 2011. Juicy and soft in blackberry and stone fruit, the wine is cradled by generous tannins and herbal tones. Full bodied, its sinewy structure suggests it would benefit from more time in bottle; cellar through 2022.",91,75,California,Coombsville,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is an inky-black wine, with soft, jammy flavors of blackberries, cherries, dark chocolate and oak. The tannins are mountain thick but as refined as modern winemaking can make them. And the finish? Sweet and dry at the same time, which only a good wine can accomplish. Needs 5‚Äì7 years in the cellar.",92,75,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is an interesting and different wine. It's much lower in alcohol than most Cabs, but completely dry, with a tobacco and sage pull to the black currant flavors. The firm tannins suggest cellar possibilities.",90,60,California,Carneros,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is an interesting medium-bodied wine from one of the oldest and largest wineries in the foothills. It is not heavy or rich, but has an appetizing dry flavor and firm texture. It will pair well with food since it has good balance.",88,18,California,Amador County,Barbera
US,"This is an intriguing wine, with notes of dried sage, fresh herbs, mineral and black tea. The palate offers sweet, dense, layered vanilla, clove and cherry flavors backed by dry tannins. Still young, this wine needs extended time in the cellar to be properly appreciated. Best after 2022.",89,65,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is an intriguing wine, with the extraction and the alcohol seemingly dialed back. Somewhat light in color, it brings aromas of fresh herb, sweet spice, cedar and cherry. The flavors are elegant and cranberry tart. It doesn't come off as entirely varietal but there's plenty of enjoyment to be had, especially if paired with food.",88,30,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"This is an oaky, woody and somewhat harsh white wine, made with the addition of 8% S√©millon.",83,21,California,Oakville,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"This is an oddly perfumed and puckering wine, with not much to say in the way of fruit, the oak treatment suggestive of oak chips.",83,50,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is an old-fashioned blend of Zin, Petite Sirah, Carignane, Alicante Bouchet and Grenache. It's high in alcohol, with heady flavors of wild berries, raisins, chocolate, licorice and spice. There is nothing shy about it, and it's best paired with barbecue.",87,35,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
US,"This is an opulently lush and bold, full-bodied wine, ripe and soft on the palate with a distinct hit of oak on the entry. It evolves in the glass to reveal crisper notions of green apple, nutmeg and lemon-lime.",91,39,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is an orange wine, intentionally oxidized and left in barrel for two years. It's very much like a fino Sherry, with comparable aromatics. What truly distinguishes this effort is the finish that lingers and develops more and more nuances for several minutes. Don't expect anything that resembles Chardonnay, but pair this with salted nuts, meats or fried foods and you will be delighted.",91,25,Oregon,Columbia Valley (OR),Chardonnay
US,"This is an outlier in the Brian Carter lineup of Euro-style blends, a single vineyard, pure varietal Cabernet. As such, it drills down deeply into the character of Washington terroir as captured in a Cab-friendly site, the Stone Tree Vineyard in the heart of the Wahluke Slope AVA.

Lean in flavor and light in body, this wine is bright and refreshing to sip, alive with good acidity and light citrus flavors that light up all corners of the mouth.",90,20,California,High Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"This is an unoaked Chardonnay, but it's so rich and forward in fruit, you may not even miss that smoky wood edge. Explodes with pineapple, peach, pear, apple, vanilla, honey and dusty spice flavors.",88,24,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is an unusual example of this variety, with aromas of exotic spice, flowers and herb. The palate has tart cranberry flavors that seem lacking in concentration.",85,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Malbec
US,"This is an unusual wine with aromas of damp herbs, bay leaf, chocolate and citrus. The flavors are sweet and chocolaty with a grainy feel.",87,36,Oregon,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Tempranillo
US,"This is an unusually complex and intricate wine that has more than simple crispness. It starts with grapefruit and bitter apple aromas and builds toward vibrant but rich grapefruit, mineral and savory consomm√© flavors. The texture is broad and mouthfilling but well supported and balanced by acidity. A great debut for Berryhill.",91,15,California,Lodi,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"This is an up-and-coming variety for the state. High-toned aromas of lime leaf and citrus are followed by a lean, almost faint but still but well-balanced palate with a thread of acidity running through it. Pair it with food to see it at its best.",88,32,Washington,Washington,Grenache Blanc
US,"This is an upscale Cabernet, rich in black currants, mocha and oak, and framed in sturdy tannins. Shows lots of class despite the statewide California appellation.",90,70,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is another fantastic vintage of this Zinfandel, blended smaller amounts of Mourv√®dre and Petite Sirah. It offers a wealth of soft, juicy milk chocolate and cherry pie character and is high in acidity and dusty tannin. A beautiful, memorable testament to what this variety can be.",94,58,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
US,"This is another fine Chardonnay from Talley, a great Central Coast producer. This is the second label, and for the price, you'll get a terrific Chardonnay that's creamy and rich in oranges, kiwi fruits and golden mangoes, but bright in acidity.",89,16,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is another outstanding vintage for Seven Hills Malbec, clearly one of the best in the Northwest. Dark, concentrated and impeccably focused, this mixes raspberry and cherry fruits with threads of smoke, espresso and dark, roasted wood. The tannins are gorgeous‚Äîsmooth, powerful and stylish to the point of silkiness. Licorice and dark chocolate put the bow on the finish.",92,30,Oregon,Walla Walla Valley (OR),Malbec
US,"This is appealing for its flavors of fresh-sliced Bosch pear, plus a pear-like graininess on the palate. It has some residual sugar, just enough to round out the acids, and overall it's a nicely balanced wine drinking very well right now.",89,14,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Pinot Gris
US,"This is arguably Firestone's best Chardonnay in many years‚Äîmaybe ever. It's rich, creamy and powerful in Chardonnay flavor, flooding the mouth with flavors of ripe tropical fruit, apricot, buttered toast, vanilla cream and spice.",93,27,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is as good a Pinot Gris as this producer has ever made. Apples and stone fruits contribute a fleshy, flavorful mid-palate. Peppery spice and a hint of brioche add complexity and interest. The wine is perfectly balanced and ready to drink immediately.",90,17,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"This is as well-balanced an interpretation of Roussanne as they come in California‚Äîproudly plump but not flabby. Light gold in color, it offers caramelized banana, custard, beeswax and apple blossom aromas. A backbone of lemony acidity runs through the palate, buttressed with ripe melon, mango and more tropical fruit flavors.",92,30,California,Santa Barbara County,Roussanne
US,"This is Bacchus vineyard fruit, as per normal ‚Äì these vines are something like 35 years old. It's all stainless-steel fermented, aged on the lees and finished at 13% alcohol. Fruit flavors of peach and pineapple fill the mouth with round, lightly spicy flavors. It's ripe but not sweet, tart but not too citrusy. Good balance and texture through the finish.",88,11,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sauvignon Blanc
US,"This is Baileyana's top Chardonnay, and the '06 defines what makes Edna Valley such a special place to grow it. Acidity and ripeness are the stars, with bright, explosive flavors of pineapples, pears, Meyer lemons, limes and kiwi fruits. The smoky, spicy oak is perfectly integrated into this delightful wine.",92,30,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is Baldacci's regular Cab, although most wineries would be content for it to be their reserve. It's a powerful, rich young wine, massive in blackberry, currant and oak flavors, with a succulent edge of milk chocolate. The tannins are pure Stags Leap, giving a complex contrapuntal balance of grip and structure to the opulent fruit. Just fabulous in every aspect, a wine to dazzle. Drink now through 2010, at least.",95,55,California,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is barrel-fermented in one-third new French oak. The fruit is perfectly ripe, clean and expansive, running from apple into light tropical flavors. There are light hints of honey and caramel, but, as usual, the fruit is front and center, and the barrels play a supporting role. Previous vintages of this wine have proven to be ageworthy, with a prime drinking window from 2020‚Äì2022.",92,45,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is box wine taken seriously, even featuring a picture of winemaker Denise Wordenon. Fresh-squeezed blueberry fruit mixes with black rocks, milk chocolate and cedar on the nose, followed by an easy-to-quaff juiciness on the lightly bodied palate.

US,"This is bright and smooth, with forward berry fruit and just the right amount of chocolaty oak. Supple and tangy, with a lip-smacking finish.",87,22,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
US,"This is built to impress through its sheer power. With a little Petit Verdot blended in, which adds a floral character, it's marked by an intense flavor of ripe wild blackberries, with a dried berry quality that's suggestive of currants and a liqueur fullness, courtesy of the high alcohol. The French oak is a full 100% new, and is in keeping with the wine's volume. So rich and tannic now, it's barely drinkable. Give it at least 6‚Äì8 years in a good cellar and see what happens.",94,125,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is certainly dramatic in structure, akin to a young Pauillac from Bordeaux, with concentrated currant, cherry, pencil lead and cedar flavors wrapped into youthfully hard tannins. It needs time, and should soften with increased complexity by 2009. Could reward with even longer cellaring, but '04 was not a great vintage.",93,150,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is classic Beringer Private Reserve Chard, ripe, oaky, lush, balanced and utterly delicious. There's a lot of everything, from massive tropical and citrus fruits to creamy lees. The malolactic fermentation helps make it buttery and 80% new French oak brings buttered toast and vanilla-bean richness. Balance comes by way of acidity and minerality.",92,44,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is classic Dry Creek Zin‚Äîrobust, heady, rich in tannins, spicy and insanely flavorful. Explodes with briary, brambly wild berries, mocha, tobacco, anise, dried pine needles and exotic sandalwood notes. Really delicious now, and should age well over the next 10 years, gradually mellowing and shedding fruit and tannins.",92,35,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel

US,"This is Clos Pegase's basic, least expensive Cabernet, but it shows the effort proprietor Jan Shrem has put into the winery and vineyards over the years. It's quite a good wine, rich with gorgeous tannins framing ripe currant, cassis, chocolate and licorice flavors. At its best now and for a few years, this 100% Cab is, in a word, luscious.",92,35,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is complex and compelling. A spicy, minty, thyme-like character comes out in the aroma and continues in the flavor, most likely from some new barrels used in aging the wine.

US,"This is crisp in acidity, tasting slightly sweet in citrus and apricot jam, with notes of green pepper and gooseberry that provide balancing complexity. It has the versatility to pair with a wide range of foods, including Asian-style fare and roasted chicken.",87,22,California,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"This is declassified ice wine, picked frozen. It does not have the depth of the other dessert wines from Viento, but it is a remarkable effort, textural and delicate, with threads of straw, honey, cracker, candied tropical fruits and more, but all in a light and delicate style. This could easily become a wine that will amaze people in a blind tasting given the price.",91,20,Oregon,Columbia Gorge (OR),Riesling
US,"This is definitely one of Washington's best Sangioveses, capturing the astringency and natural acidity of the grape, but filling in the mid-palate with chewy fruit flavors of berry and spicy cranberry. The light herbal characteristics of the vineyard come through, adding details of leaf and herb. Since this is a 2004, it is already showing some development in the bottle and is drinking very well right now.",90,38,Washington,Yakima Valley,Sangiovese
US,"This is described as a country-style wine because of its rugged tannins and angular, rough mouthfeel. The deeply plummy flavors are ripe, but very dry. The biggest problem may be the acids, which are very low. You long for more crispness and life, something to offset the fruitiness.",84,23,California,Sonoma County,Merlot
US,"This is done in a crisp, fresh and leesy style, with lime-drenched minerality. Flavors of white peach and guava gain volume and density as the wine warms on the palate. It was kept from malolactic fermentation, enlivening a lingering, resonant finish.",91,19,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"This is done in a soft, loose-knit, wide-open style‚Äînot the usual crisp and racy Riesling found in the Northwest. Apple and orange fruits are accented with notes of cracker and grain. It feels a bit flat in the finish. Drink up.",85,22,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Riesling
US,"This is done in an open, palate-friendly style, with rich, generous black fruits accented with cocoa, coffee and caramel. There's a streak of vanilla custard also, and the fruit has enough depth and mass to hold up through a satisfying finish.",91,29,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"This is Doubleback's first vintage to include estate-grown grapes in the blend. Truffle, mocha and ripe purple-fruit scents explode from the glass. Ample acidity underscores the chewy tannins. A dense and ageworthy wine, this needs more bottle-age to show its best; try after 2018.",94,89,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is dry, almost sour, despite its low alcohol, and feels disjointed. Along with the sour citrus flavor is a conflicting streak of too-ripe fruit. Interesting components, but they may or may not knit together with more bottle age.",85,22,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling

This great Zinfandel is a joy to drink.",92,38,California,Alexander Valley,Zinfandel

US,"This is dry, tart in acidity and stimulating in lemongrass and pear flavors. It has a touch of New Zealand-style gooseberry, demonstrating a green-peppercorn-like grassiness. Try pairing it with a goat cheese and thyme omelet for weekend brunch.",88,13,California,Sonoma County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"This is Duckhorn's second label for their Napa Bordeaux reds, and with this '06 vintage, it's on the thin, herbal side, with only modest cherry-berry flavors. Dry and very tannic, it's not an ager.",85,30,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"This is Dutton Estate's unoaked Sauvignon Blanc. It did not go through the malolactic fermentation, but it started as very ripe grapes, so what you get is pure citrus, Asian pear, white peach and green apple flavor, zesty and clean in acidity, with slight a sweetness in the finish. Nice with Indian, Chinese, Vietnamese fare.",88,20,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"This is easily the greatest of Foxen's new Chardonnays. It show the dryness and crisp acidity of the other bottlings, but is enormously rich and complex in oak-inspired pineapple, peach, cr√®me br√ªl√©e, buttered toast, honey and mineral flavors.

US,"This is finished in a dense, dark, super-saturated style, and aged in two thirds new French oak barrels.

Just a little heat in the finish.",93,39,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend

Soft, lemony acidity on the midpalate gets a boost of citrus rind and saline on the finish.",87,12,New York,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay
US,"This is J's best Pinot Gris in years. It's rich and focused, with bright acidity, a clean mouthfeel and complex orange, mango, honey and vanilla flavors.",88,15,California,California,Pinot Gris
US,"This is just a bit on the sweet side, but there is plenty of acidity to be found. It's fruity, peachy, succulent and fresh.",87,8,Washington,Washington,Riesling
US,"This is just delicious, showing all the fine attributes you'd want from a California Cabernet, except ageability. But who cares, when it's this rich in blackberry and cherry jam, cassis and chocolate, and so balanced? Winemaker John Falcone has brought his years of thoughtful winemaking to this Cab, and of course the favorable 2009 vintage helped.",91,50,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is Langetwins's first vintage of Malbec from estate vineyards and it leaves a bit to be desired. Flat and a tad watery, it's a one-dimensional quaff.",80,15,California,Lodi,Malbec
US,"This is light and seems a little sparkly, as if there is a hint of secondary fermentation going on. For Cab Franc it's light and generic, without the spice or substance of the grape.",82,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Franc
US,"This is lively and tart, suggesting citrus rind, grapefruit and juniper berries. There's a snap to the acidity and some bitterness in the finishing flavors.",87,18,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"This is made from 100% Cabernet grown in the St. Helena estate vineyard. The wine is exceptionally pure and delicious, rich in black currant, chocolate, black cherry and lots of toasty new French oak. The all-important tannins are exquisitely ripe and as fine as velvet. Nowhere near ready, this wine wants a good eight years in the cellar, and will gradually evolve through the mid-2020s, at the very least.",95,85,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is made from a majority Cabernet Sauvignon, with 11% Merlot and 2% Cabernet Franc. This makes for a softly layered tease of cinnamon, cedar and brush, with the tannins dry and grippy. Black licorice and violet dot the nose and palate. Drink now‚Äì2020.",91,90,California,Spring Mountain District,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"This is made from equal parts Cabernet Franc and Merlot, with small additions of Malbec. Juicy, it reveals a raisiny quality of ripeness around integrated oak and generous tannin.",86,75,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"This is made from the winery's estate vineyard, but from lots not included in the main blend, which costs twice as much. You'll find plenty of tannins in this darkly colored, impressively concentrated 100% Cabernet. It's fresh, soft and juicy in blackberry and cherry jam flavors, with a rich earthiness. Just delightful for drinking over the next four years, and a great value.",93,30,California,Sonoma Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is made in a rich style, so the aroma is handsomely oaky, like buttered toast, the flavors are as rich as pear syrup and vanilla bean, the texture and body are full and the finish lingers. Fans of unoaked Chardonnay need not apply.",89,22,California,Mendocino,Chardonnay
US,"This is made in the smooth, oaky and rich style of the modern cult Cabernet. It offers lots of ripe, jammy blackberries, plus notes of sweet, intense black and red currants, dark chocolate tart, black licorice and smoky oak. The tannins are tough but structured, so give it six years in the cellar and see what happens.",91,125,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is made in the somewhat austere style of a Loire valley Chinon, done well here, adding nothing harsh, bitter or unpleasant to the wine. You will also find soft plum and cherry fruit, modest but perfectly ripe and proportionate, rounding out the midpalate.",88,20,Washington,Washington,Cabernet Franc
US,"This is Marimar's unoaked Chardonnay from the estate vineyard. In keeping with past vintages, it's so rich and savory, you won't even notice the absence of barrel influence. The wine is rich and complex in tangerine, apricot, lime, lemon and vanilla flavors, brightened by exquisite acidity.",91,29,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is much creamier, with much more leesy flavor than the regular bottling, but not as much ripe fruit (perhaps because it is from a different vintage). Various flavors of nuts, honey, spice and light tropical fruit mingle in a well balanced finish.",89,15,Oregon,Oregon,Chardonnay
US,"This is not a showy wine, but the sense of reserve, good acidity, fresh flavors and good balance form an enjoyable picture that will be versatile with food.",87,20,California,Sierra Foothills,Chardonnay

US,"This is not necessarily a classic Grenache, but there is no denying its bold but sophisticated personality. Pomegranate and blackberry aromas are tinged with earthiness, and the flavors are rich in fruit as well. The texture is lush and the body is very full. Think of it as very ripe and delicious, while sleek and smooth in spite of high alcohol.",90,25,California,Contra Costa County,Grenache
US,"This is not your parents' crisp and lean Barbera. Ripe, juicy and concentrated, it's so rich and opulent that it seems sweet. From the aromas through the lingeirng finish, it generously doles out raspberry syrup and blackberry jam notes, as well as a chocolaty accent from oak.",91,50,California,Livermore Valley,Barbera
US,"This is off-dry to sweet, with honey, orange and vanilla flavors with a touch of petrol.",84,14,California,Santa Barbara County,Riesling
US,"This is old vine (1978), Wente clone Chardonnay, with bright, spicy fruit flavors of banana, pear and melon. A touch of toast and cracker comes from barrel-fermentation in neutral French oak. Forward and rich, this is one to drink up while it's young and fresh.",90,28,Washington,Yakima Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is on the light side, with simple flavors and a juicy, soft texture that shows very little tannin. Aromas and flavors recall cherries and strawberries.",84,13,California,Lodi,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is one of Lynmar's most expensive Chardonnays, of their six 2011s. It's also one of the most forward and oakiest. Your first impression is of sweet buttered toast, sprinkled with brown sugar and drizzled with melted butterscotch. Then the tropical fruits kick in, brightened with citrusy acids. It's an impressive feat, but the wine feels overworked, and lacks the sustaining interest of Lynmar's other bottlings.",88,70,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay

US,"This is one of the best balanced and most elegant Zins around. Very fresh in aroma, it's slightly yeasty like freshly fermented wine, and with subtly gorgeous cherry and blackberry flavors layered with light cedar and cocoa spiciness. Not only is the finish lingering, but the wine still tasted great two days after pulling the cork.",92,30,California,Mokelumne River,Zinfandel
US,"This is one of the best Bordeaux blends now available from Paso Robles. Based on Cabernet Sauvignon, it's enormously ripe in blackberry jam, currant, chocolate and cedar flavors that finish lush and spicy. The tannins are strong, but negotiable with barbecue.",90,42,California,Paso Robles,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"This is one of the best buys on the market now for a Cabernet of this quality at this price. It's a wonderful wine, well structured and dry, with lush flavors of blackberries, currants, herbs and cedar that are wrapped into firm, ripe tannins. Should develop additional complexity through 2014.",90,20,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is one of the best value-oriented Sauvignon Blancs in California. It's dry and tart with acidity, along with rewarding flavors of lemons, limes, golden mangoes and gooseberries.",88,10,California,California,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"This is one of the better California Tempranillos out there. It's delicate and silky on the palate, and earthy despite rich raspberry and cherry fruit. Balanced with crisp acidity and a scour of dusty tannins, it's complex enough to enjoy with a great steak, especially with mushrooms. A consistent followup to the winery's 2010.",89,27,California,California,Tempranillo
US,"This is one of the bigger, more powerful Chardonnays out there in the market. It's triumphant in ripe pineapple jam, apricot-infused cr√®me br√ªl√©e, Meyer lemon custard, buttered toast and cinnamon spice flavors, wrapped into a creamy rich texture that finishes dry and crisp. May lack subtlety, but what immense pleasure it offers.",92,44,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
US,"This is one of the biggest, richest Chardonnays that Rodney Strong has ever produced, and no wonder, as longtime winemaker Rick Sayre was assisted by David Ramey as a consultant. The wine has Ramey-esque proportions, gigantic in fleshy tropical fruit, caramel, vanilla cream, butterscotch and meringue flavors. It's so softly decadent, it's almost better as a cocktail wine than with food.",91,30,California,Sonoma County,Chardonnay
US,"This is one of the few Cab Francs in California that works on its own. It's really a gorgeous wine, showing the full-bodied firmness of Cabernet Sauvignon, but without the tannic weight and density. The flavors veer toward scrumptious red cherries, red currants, milk chocolate and anise, with a dry, complex finish. Lovely with a fine grilled steak and rosemary new potatoes.",93,60,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Franc
US,"This is one of the Fillippini family winery's best barrel blends, comprised of 71% Cabernet Sauvignon, 14% Malbec, 10% Merlot and 5% Petit Verdot. The nose shows Concord grape, wisteria and black licorice aromas, while the palate doubles down on the licorice spice, with blueberry fruit, char and pepper in the background.",88,45,California,Paso Robles,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"This is one of the more New Zealand-like Sauvignon Blancs out there, and that's a compliment. The wine is thoroughly dry and very crisp in acidity, with a grassy, lemony, minerally profile that makes it savory. Approximately one-fifth was barrel fermented, adding just the right touch of cream and smoke.",91,24,California,Sonoma County,Sauvignon Blanc

US,"This is one of the most beloved Chardonnays from Santa Barbara County, and for good reason: Bryan Babcock manages to imbue his wine with buttery richness yet also balance it with acidity and smoke. Honeysuckle, almond and Gravenstein apple aromas lead into energetic yet creamy marshmallow and poached pear flavors, all cut with citrusy acidity.",93,45,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"This is one of the most Chablis-style Chardonnays on the market. It's bone dry, and has a steely, minerally elegance made complex with layers of pineapples and limes, and even a honeysuckle richness. The oak, interestingly, comes from Hungary. A terrific wine, far from the overoaked, buttered popcorn style so popular now. Production was only 227 cases.",94,50,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"This is one of the most dramatic Chardonnays of the vintage, which was a difficult one owing to the coldest summer in many years. Somehow, Hartford Court's viticulturalists pulled it off. There's no trace of the greenness or unripeness that mark some other '11 Chards. Instead, you'll find waves of awesomely ripe apricots, tangerines and pears, enriched with smoky oak and brightened with brisk acidity. Terrific now and over the next 4‚Äì5 years.",94,70,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
US,"This is one of the most interesting Merlots of the vintage because it combines fruity ripeness with herbal and vegetal notes to create a complex wine. Blackberry and cassis, a bit of stewed tomato and mushroom, grilled meat, green olives and roasted coffee beans only begin to describe it. Dry and harmonious.",93,34,California,Sonoma Valley,Merlot
US,"This is one of the richer examples of Pinot Gris out there. It's a flamboyant wine that's creamy, smoky and ripe, with an array of tropical fruit, citrus, peach, green apple and white flower flavors, as well as a fine, stony minerality.",90,26,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Pinot Gris
US,"This is one of the winery's last takes on this vineyard, as they move their focus to Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. The nose is blackberry liqueur lifted with chopped black sage, fennel stalk and tobacco leaf. Flavors run from dark red fruit to black spices to tartness on the finish, like a balsamic reduction sauce.",93,55,California,Paso Robles,G-S-M
US,"This is one of those fresh, young Cabs that reminds you of Beaujolais. It's fruity and silky and jammy, with a pink bubblegum gassiness. Give it a chill, cut it with some sparkling water, put in a slice of strawberry and enjoy.",84,12,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is one of those wines that could be anything from Chardonnay to Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc. It doesn't really matter, because it's pleasant and easy to drink, with sweet flavors of tangerines and vanilla.",86,20,California,Central Coast,Chardonnay
US,"This is Peachy Canyon's 100% Zinfandel, unblended, and it's a true expression of the variety, Paso Robles style. That means it's softly voluptuous and almost to the point of overripeness, with blackberry, raisin and spice flavors. Drink now.",88,36,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
US,"This is Peju's best Sauvignon Blanc in many years. It's bone dry and elegantly crisp in acidity, a clean, vibrant, food-friendly wine. With just a hint of oak, it shows rich flavors of Meyer lemons and limes, with exotic notes of papaya and white flowers. What a great comeback.",90,22,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"This is Pepper Bridge and Seven Hills fruit, delicately managed, so as not to overwhelm the fruit. The strawberry/raspberry sweetness is there, and a wash of molasses carries it into a smooth, luscious finish. The wine is not complex‚Äîjust very tasty.",88,32,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is Pepper Bridge Merlot, and it beautifully expresses the vineyard trademarks: fresh fruit flavors of strawberry and raspberry, spread out broadly across the palate, and backed with tart acids and light tannins. There is a strong streak of Asian spicebox as well, but overall the wineis very approachable, which makes it is a Merlot to enjoy with rich fish, such as salmon. It's bright and lightly spicy and not too heavy.",89,28,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"This is perfumed with lovely violets and tight layers of mixed berries, currants and hints of truffle. It's young and muscular, with a pleasing chewy texture to the tannins. There is the sense that time will unfold the flavors and add nuances of herb and earth, capturing the varietal notes that can be   obliterated by over-ripe fruit and too much new oak.",90,32,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is Pinot Gris without any particular varietal character; it could be almost anything. It's got tart, lemon-flavored fruit and a thin, watery finish.",82,13,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"This is pleasant and complex on the nose, with hints of violet, ripe black cherry and a savory meat note that lingers. The palate could use a tad more concentration, but it's elegant in style with lean cherry flavor and a flurry of fresh green and floral accents.",85,30,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is plenty ripe, with alcohol just under 15%. Fruit flavors are a little over the top, getting into pruney, or at least a cooked, compote character. But you'll find berries galore, the acidity to balance and a streak of bark in the tannins.",87,25,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Grenache
US,"This is possibly the richest, ripest unoaked Chardonnay ever made in California. It's so powerful with tropical fruit, lemon drop, lime, peach and honey flavors, it might just blow your mind. High acidity adds balance and gives the wine mouthwatering tartness.",93,48,California,Sonoma Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is pretty good Zin, fully ripened and showing classic wild berry and spice notes, although there‚Äôs an earthy, cardboardy aroma that‚Äôs a little off-putting. The tannins are very soft, and the acidity is a bit low, making it simple and one-dimensional. Still, not a bad deal at this price.",84,10,California,Sierra Foothills,Zinfandel
US,"This is pretty slender, but it gets the Chardonnay job done with its flavors of buttered toast, cream and peach.",84,12,California,California,Chardonnay
US,"This is pure Cabernet from one of Washington's oldest vineyards. Cold Creek is a hot site, and its grapes are scattered throughout many of the Ste. Michelle brands, often providing the core fruit. Here is the essence, a wine that opens a bit grudgingly, but has structure and concentration if you take the time to let it blossom. Dense cherry and cassis fruit is tightly wound with balancing acids. The use of new oak is restrained, but sufficient, and this is a wine that should age nicely for many years.",91,26,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is pure Cabernet‚Äîtight, tannic and terroir-driven. It has a dense mix of fruit, rock, earth and herb flavors that are nicely integrated, with a full palate and fine complexity and density. A little more barrel toast would put the icing on the cake.",94,45,Washington,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is pure Merlot from 10-year-old vines. Lush and chocolaty, it offers a broad, ripe and appealing set of seamless black fruit flavors. Powerful and high-toned, this adds licorice and mocha to the expansive finish.",90,75,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"This is pure Washington Merlot, sourced from Klipsun, Ciel du Cheval and the original 1976 planting at Kiona. Initially stiff and herbal, it opens grudgingly, streaked with black olive, black cherry, earth and dark chocolate. The muscularity is a fine demonstration of why and how Washington Merlot is ageworthy; a showcase of tight black raspberry and cassis, with a core of iron.",91,38,Washington,Red Mountain,Merlot
US,"This is quickly maturing, with strong flavors of vanilla rather than fruit. Tannins are stiff and strong. Drink now.",85,15,Washington,Washington,Merlot
US,"This is quite crisp and clean, with fairly typical flavors for Washington Pinot Gris. Which is to say, not nearly as fleshy as the wines from Oregon, with less of the juicy pear character. There's plenty of acid, more like green apple than ripe pear. It's a soundly made wine, clean and fresh, but less varietally distinctive than one would hope for.",85,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Pinot Gris
US,"This is quite light and lemony, closer to an Italian Pinot Grigio than to an Oregon Pinot Gris. What it lacks in flesh it compensates for in freshness and vitality; the subtle fruit flavors suggest Asian pear, jicama and cucumber. It would be a lovely match for a light fish such as rainbow trout or Dover sole.",87,13,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Pinot Gris
US,"This is remarkable, with modest alcohol and a concentrated, ageworthy structure. Lime and pineapple flavors are enhanced with lively, gin-like botanicals. There is vivid acidity and a lick of butterscotch on the finish.",93,35,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
US,"This is rich and appealing in orange and lemon marmalade and buttered toast flavors. It's delicious, balanced by crisp acidity and minerality. A flashy wine worth drinking now for its freshness and vicacity.",87,24,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is rich and dense in blackberry and cherry jam, currant, mocha, anise and smoky cedar flavors. The mountain tannins are strong but refined, and the finish is long and spicy. It's a Bordeaux blend based on Cabernet Sauvignon, but be forewarned: It's high in alcohol.",93,90,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"This is rich, ripe, fat and seemingly oaky. It may be too much of a good thing. Massive in caramelized, butterscotch, pineapple, peach, apricot, lime and cotton candy flavors, it might overpower any food you have it with. Almost better as a cocktail sipper.",90,40,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is rich, soft and vibrant in blackberry, blueberry jam and mocha flavors, which are wrapped into complex tannins, finishing dry and spicy. This shows superior pedigree.",92,75,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is right up there with previous vintages of Krutz's Malbec, which have been among the best in California. It's certainly not a shy wine, showing Malbec's power to dazzle with its sheer volume. Offering endless waves of blackberry and black pepper, with thick tannins and vibrant acidity, this is the perfect wine to drink now with charbroiled beef.",93,60,California,Napa Valley,Malbec
US,"This is Robert Mondavi winemaker Genevieve Janssens own micro-project with husband Luc, and she doesn't miss the chance to craft a classic, gorgeous wine. Blending 85% Cabernet Sauvignon from Hendry Ranch and 15% Cabernet Franc from Detert East Vineyard, this wine offers luxurious aromatics and a juicy core of blackberry, black cherry and soft, integrated tannin, a beautiful marriage of sites and vintner.",95,145,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"This is robust, jammy and tart, with blackberry jam and root beer flavors, finished with swirls of melted dark chocolate and pepper. It tastes like classic Zinfandel, with a lush finish. It's a natural choice for barbecue and meat stews.",87,25,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel
US,"This is serious and concentrated, probably built to age a few more years before its peak. It smells soaked with black cherry and black currant aromas, tastes deep, ripe and compelling, and feels full bodied and firmly tannic. The flavors are powerful enough to match the big texture, so it should improve through 2020.",91,25,California,Mendocino County,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is serviceable but rather bland, with a dusting of cinnamon spice and simple, tart fruit.",85,16,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is sharper and more rustic than most other expensive Rutherford Cabernets, with a cut of citrusy acidity that dominates the cherry and herb flavors. While it's tough and hard to appreciate now, you never know if these aggressive young wines will develop with time. This one doesn't seem like it will benefit, so drink up.",85,65,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is showing an extraordinary amount of toasty oak in the nose, and once in the mouth it seems as if the oak and toast flavors overwhelm everything else. The fruit is very much on the light side, and can't begin to stand up to all the toast and butterscotch that is being tossed around. It's not bad, but it has not yet found its balance, and finishes with some lightly stemmy tannins.",84,23,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is singer/songwriter John Legend's inaugural wine project in conjunction with Raymond Vineyards in the Napa Valley. Combining 85% Cabernet Sauvignon with 15% Petit Verdot, it tells a powerful story in thick layers of blackberry cobbler, chocolate and coffee, the tannin and oak integrated and silky smooth. This is a wine of great presence.",91,85,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is so bold and rich, it could stop a tsunami of barbacue sauce and a herd of galloping babyback ribs. They say the age of the vines is between 90‚Äì110 years. This wine is sheer lusciousness, with flavors of wild blackberries, cola and plums, along with a blueberry jam and black pepper finish.",91,30,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
US,"This is so smooth, rich and mellow, you hardly notice how intense the tannins are. But they are hard, and lock down the flavors of black currant and black licorice, plus the complex notes of minerals, roasted game and dark spices. Drink this Malbec-based blend now after decanting and over the next six years.",93,75,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"This is soft and gentle, with easy berry, herb, cola and sandalwood flavors. Drink now, as this is about as good as it will ever be.",87,17,California,Sonoma County,Merlot
US,"This is soft and lightly scented with citrus. Aromas of lemon peel precede light flavors of citrus and green apple. It's a simple, quaffable white wine, with a bit of Riesling and Viognier in the blend.",85,10,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay

US,"This is soft and round with pleasing flavors of black cherry and plum. Hints of coffee and chocolate do not tamper with the basic core of clean, ripe fruit. It's quite nicely made, drinking well, and comes into focus in the extended finish.",88,24,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"This is something you're not likely to see every day‚Äîa 10-year-old sparkling wine made from 100% Pinot Gris. Lacks the finesse and minerality of those Alsatian sparkling wines, but the flavors have been smoothed out over the years, and a pleasing toasty streak has crept into the tart pear skin fruit.",86,25,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"This is sort of a junior version of Talbott's more expensive Sleepy Hollow Chardonnay. It resembles it in many ways, offering concentrated tropical and citrus fruit flavors, highlighted by brisk acidity and wrapped into a creamy texture.",88,24,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
US,"This is sort of a second wine of the respected veteran winemaker, Nick Goldschmidt, who bottles his more expensive brand under his last name. But there's nothing second-rate about the wine. It's classic Alexander Valley, soft and a little herbal, and rich in cherry, red currant, licorice, sweet vanilla oak and peppery spice flavors. Lovely now, and with the integrity to evolve for a decade.",93,40,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is sourced from a steep site on the southern end of the appellation, a sunny location that provides concentration and weight to the wine. Smoky, herbal and earthy, it offers a wealth of rounded tannin and approachable texture that's complemented by dark cherry, blackberry, clove and vanilla.",90,50,California,Knights Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is sourced from the excellent Seven Hills vineyard, yet it lacks the heft and muscle of the winery's Columbia Valley Merlot, sourced from a mix of sites. Here the flavors suggest cherry candy, with a big streak of licorice. The tannins are chewy and astringent.",87,39,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is stainless fermented and aged on the lees in steel barrels, a nice idea that brings leesy creaminess to pretty fruit flavors of melon and citrus. It's an elegant Viognier, with the sort of fresh herbal highlights that freshen up a good cocktail, adding persistence to the mouthfeel.",89,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier
US,"This is stunningly good single-vineyard wine. The fruit shows well-ripened apples and peaches all the way into pineapples and mangoes, offering up a cascade of flavors that tumble across the palate. Oak shadings are generous, but in balance. Displays a crispness and delicacy of acids more usually associated with cooler regions. Absolutely first class.",92,45,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is stunningly rich in mouthfeel, texture and overall weight. Buttered, toasted nuts and creamy fruits coat the mouth. Oranges, apples and pears roll smoothly and seamlessly along the palate, with a juicy kick to the finish.",92,40,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is subtle and almost neutral in flavor, but does have enough crisp mouthfeel to make it taste appetizing. It delivers slight apple-skin aromas and cucumber flavors, light body and a short finish.",85,15,California,Potter Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"This is such a refreshing take on the variety, still robust and rich in body, yet possessed of firm acidity and a crispness of cherry kirsch and pomegranate. It practically shouts violets and roses on the nose, following through on the palate with a delicacy of power that's entirely surprising. The finish is a mix of allspice and white pepper.",92,50,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
US,"This is surprisingly light, having dropped significantly in alcohol from the previous vintage. Green-fruit flavors touch on banana and apple, and the wood‚Äî31% new and 26% once-used‚Äîseems to show a bit of rawness. Give this another couple of years of bottle age before opening.",87,40,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is Swanson's top Cabernet, which includes a splash of Merlot. As always, it's rich, tannic and dry, and it possesses a deep core of blackberry and black currant flavors. It seems more tannic and sharp than in previous vintages, which suggests its ageability. Try holding it until 2015.",90,75,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is tart and briary in the mouth, with less-than-ripe tannins and fruit. This has a decent blackberry flavor. Drink up.",86,38,California,Monterey County,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This is taut and dense, and requires time and air to untangle. Deep, dark fruits are mixed in with layers of black olive, smoke, compost, tar, moist earth and herb‚Äîa delicious m√©lange of flavors that promises good things to come as the wine ages.

US,"This is technically a white wine but with eyes closed it could be taken for a big red. The color is orange, the aromas are earthy and extremely citric, while the flavors are laser focused on orange and lemon zest. Acidity and tannins coat the palate and give it a mouth-puckering grip. It's not for the meek, but the adventurous will love it.",91,32,California,El Dorado,Roussanne
US,"This is the 33rd vintage of this landmark Zinfandel, which, since it's a blend that includes just 74% Zinfandel in it, isn't technically Zinfandel at all. Whatever. It's just plain delicious, old-vine, succulent juice. Jammy, juicy, vibrant and tight, it has a long life ahead.",90,30,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel
US,"This is the best Obsidian Cab since the 2002, and for similar reasons. It was a good vintage for Cabernet.

US,"This is the darkest, biggest, richest of Raymond's 2007 Cabernets. It's ripe and full in blackberries and currants, with a thick coating of sweet, toasty oak, but it's not really drinkable now because the tannins are so strong. Designed for the cellar, it should develop bottle complexity over the next 10‚Äì12 years.",92,85,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is the deal of the century for wine made at this level from vines dating back as far as 1881, the wine sourced from two sites, the Saitone and Banfield ranches. Yeasty baked bread and juicy strawberry commingle around black currant and blood orange, the texture smoothly seductive, with a cradling of dried herb as a back note.",92,28,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
US,"This is the finest Cabernet from Gordon Estate in some time; forward and pretty, with a juicy mix of red fruits. The raspberry and cherry and currant flavors are nicely defined and deep, underscored with crisp acidity, and showing the sort of youthful concentration that suggests further cellaring is in order. Nonetheless, it's a wine to enjoy right away simply for its luscious, exuberant fruit.",91,26,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon

The 22 months in barrel brings an interesting hint of caramel to a nicely balanced finish.",91,35,Washington,Yakima Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

Sourced from the Upland vineyard in the tiny Snipes Mountain AVA, it is bursting with pure, sweet fruit flavors, tart and lip-smackingly juicy.

US,"This is the first Tempranillo from Zefina (just 60 cases made) from vines planted at the Alder Ridge vineyard in 1999. It is soft, fruity and dark, with some pretty spice showing in the nose. There are attractive floral notes, sweet herbs and a mix of light red fruits to follow. The tannins are soft and the acids are well under control, leading into a lightly chocolaty finish.",87,25,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Tempranillo
US,"This is the first time a Cabernet Franc has been made at Spring Valley since 2003. It's rich and earthy, tannic and concentrated, with plum and black cherry dusted with light mocha.

A wisp of smoke appears at the end.",92,85,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon

Beautifully proportioned, deep and cellarworthy.",95,45,Washington,Red Mountain,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"This is the medium-dry Riesling from this estate vineyard, a notch lower in alcohol than the Dry bottling, and overall a bit rounder. It carries the same excellent texture, length and mix of ripe fruits, with pears and nectarines taking center stage.",92,24,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Riesling
US,"This is the most accessible, most interesting and most compelling of Sbragia's new Cabernets. It's extraordinarily powerful in the potent, sweetly refined tannins and ripe flavors of blackberries and cassis, leading to a long, rich finish. You can drink it now, but it will age effortlessly for a good 8‚Äì10 years.",95,75,California,Howell Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is the most balanced of the winery's many 2011 Zins. It's also half the price of the vineyard designates. With raspberry, cherry and cola flavors set in a flurry of spices, it doesn't have the massive overripeness of the others. But that's exactly why it's a more appealing and food-friendly wine.",90,19,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
US,"This is the most broadly appealing Chardonnay of Lynmar's wonderful 2011 offering. It makes all the right moves, with fine acidity and a hint of minerals giving structure to the tropical fruit, buttered toast and spice flavors. It's the kind of wine that makes Chard lovers smile. Best of all, it costs considerably less than  the winery's other Chards and is nearly as good.",91,35,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is the most dynamic 2011 entry in Matthias Pippig's Loner series, starting with aromas of lemon juice, lime sorbet, wet chalk, white pepper and crushed herbs. The tight, mineral-driven flavors dance across diced peaches and baked apples, with lime spritzer and baking soda thrown on top.",93,60,California,Sta. Rita Hills,Chardonnay
US,"This is the most remniscent of Chablis among Testarossa's new Chardonnays. It's a minerally, chalky wine, bone dry and with lots of acidity, which makes it racy and clean. But it also has a solid core of ripe oranges and limes. It's fine to drink now, and could even develop mushroomy bottle complexity over the next six years.",93,39,California,Chalone,Chardonnay
US,"This is the personal project of Robert Mondavi's longtime winemaker, Genevieve Janssens, and her husband, Luc. Production is only 250 cases. The blend is of the two Cabs, Sauvignon and Franc. The quality of the tannins is perfect, and so is the effortless way the wine has absorbed 100% new French oak without the wood sticking out. My only criticism, and it's a big one, is excessive ripeness that makes it Port-like. The alcohol is 15.5%.",87,125,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

Velvety soft tannins allow the fruit to speak.",93,75,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
US,"This is the producer's proprietary Merlot-driven blend, the variety comprising 60% of the whole, with 30% Cabernet Franc and 10% Cabernet Sauvignon.

Drink now through 2023.",91,135,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"This is the third of three Chardonnays named after the winemaker's daughters. The aromas bring notes of clarified butter, lees, spice, pear, pineapple and other tropical fruit. The flavors are rich but still show restraint, with a lightly creamy feel and a long finish.",91,45,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
US,"This is the third vintage for this rare Washington Tempranillo from Alexandria Nicole. It's a crowd-pleaser, with deep fruit flavors of black cherry candy, wrapped in earthy, dusty tannins. As it breathes the aromas show vanilla, lanolin and spice, and the wine has excellent weight and concentration for such young vines.",89,55,Washington,Horse Heaven Hills,Tempranillo
US,"This is the top bottling of Thomas Fogarty's ambitious Bordeaux-aimed brand, and it shows, with regionally distinctive aromas of crushed rocks, blueberry, tar and smoke. The intriguing palate is elegance defined, with sexy tannins and mineral-driven flavors of black dirt, wet slate and squeezed blueberry. It makes for enlightening drinking now, but offers measured components that will last until at least 2030.",94,95,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"This is the winery's best Cabernet Sauvignon in years. It has classic black currant flavor, enhanced by smoky oak, and feels distinguished in the mouth. It's young, but should begin to mellow and show its stuff by 2017.",90,51,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is the winery's best Chardonnay, but that's no surprise given its source: the famous Rochioli Vineyard. Right now, it's dominated by new oak influence, with buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel flavors. But there's an intense core of pineapples, oranges, green apples, nectarines and apricots, and the finish is absolutely dry. The vineyard's minerality and the Russian River's acidity provide balance. Give it until the summer of 2013, and then enjoy it for several more years.",92,45,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This is the winery's best Dijon Clones Chardonnay ever. It shows the balanced, long hangtime fruit of the vintage, bursting with ripe flavors of pineapples, oranges, honeydew melons and pears, along with toasty new French oak and vibrant acidity.

Ready to drink now.",92,46,California,Carmel Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"This is the winery's estate-grown Cabernet Sauvignon, and it opens rather stiff and herbal. It's a taut, dark and deep wine that rewards decanting, showing good concentration and dense layers of brambly berries, licorice and espresso. Age for at least another decade.",90,30,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is the winery's flagship wine, the one that made it famous decades ago. It hasn't changed much over the years. It's still tannic and austere in youth, requiring many years to develop. But it's a cellar guarantee, with a wealth of concentrated cassis and cedar flavors that are just waiting for those tannins to drop out. Best after 2010.",92,70,California,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is the winery's inaugural vintage of this wine, which blends Birch Creek Grenache (57%) and Mourv√®dre (14%) with estate Syrah.

US,"This is the winery's Left-Bank-Bordeaux-style blend, three quarters Cabernet Sauvignon. It has a pleasing mix of red and black fruits, licorice, toast and smoke, and spent two and a half years in French oak, 60% new. The wine is quite tasty and drinking well, though the blend lacks focus.",88,35,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is the winery's Meritage red, although with 75% Cabernet Sauvignon they could have bottled it as that variety. It's nearly always Sebastiani's best Bordeaux-style wine, but the '05 is something of a letdown from past vintages. It's elegantly structured and nicely flavored, with subtle currant, cherry, olive and smoke flavors, but has a bitter taste throughout.",85,35,California,Sonoma County,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"This is the winery's reserve-level 100% Cab, given the utmost care and attention. It opens shyly in cedar and blackberry before offering a luscious palate of tangy leather, dry, firm tannins and a peppery finish. From grapes designated as their own Heritage Clone, UCD 30, it beautifully expresses the appellation and should cellar well through 2020.",91,110,California,Stags Leap District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"This is the winery's stainless-steel-fermented Sauvignon Blanc. Dry and racy in acidity, it shows lemon and lime flavors, with a rich hint of tart kiwi.",89,14,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"This is three fifths Merlot, the rest spread among the other four Bordeaux grapes. It's very well crafted, showing a bit of herb along with berries and spice. What most impresses is the overall structure, and the impression of ageworthy muscle in the finish.",91,36,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"This is top drawer‚Äîelegant, detailed and richly varietal. The fruit is tart and tangy but not sour or thin.

US,"This is unusual for a reserve, in that it's lower in alcohol than the regular bottling, and more cases were produced. The light fruits and herbs‚Äîgreen apple and lemon verbena in particular‚Äîare highlighted with tarragon and citrus peel. The complexity compensates for the just-on-the-edge ripeness, and time in 20% new oak adds a buttery note to the finish.",89,33,Oregon,Chehalem Mountains,Chardonnay
US,"This is very rich in blackberries and currants, bearing lots of oak that adds caramelized toastiness.

US,"This is winemaker Rich Cushman's estate vineyard. At 25 years of age, it may well be the oldest Riesling planting in the region. The alcohol is just under 11%, but there is plenty of acid under the fruit, so despite its off-dry designation, this is a wine that would work wonderfully well with a wide variety of cheeses and appetizers. Flavors suggest pears and peaches, detailed with spice and stone.",90,14,Oregon,Columbia Gorge (OR),Riesling

The wine may open up and the fruit ascend more in a year; lovers of heavy toast can eagerly drink it up now.",85,18,California,Northern Sonoma,Zinfandel
US,"This leads with aromas of dark raspberries, toast and woodspice, seeming to still be in its shell. Flavors are high-octane, rich and sweet, with enough tannins to go the distance.

US,"This variety is one of the traditional Port grapes. It should do well as a dry wine in the hotter areas of California, but no one has figured out how to make it happen. This bottling by Kenneth Voik does not advance the cause. The wine is heavy and dull.",82,36,California,Paso Robles,Touriga Nacional

Better 2011‚Äì2013.",93,65,California,Alexander Valley,Chardonnay
US,"This vineyard has been the source of a string of rich, complex, classic Zins from Bella, and the '05 is the best yet. It's a big, lusty wine whose volume is pumped up with a dose of Petite Sirah. The flavors run toward blackberries, boysenberries, plums, coffee, carob and Asian spices.",91,36,California,Alexander Valley,Zinfandel

The Cabernet fruit falls a bit short of fully ripe, and the oak treatment does not completely mask the bitterness.",85,15,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"This Zinfandel is bone-dry and classically varietal, with briary, wild berry, black currant, mocha, raisin and peppery spice flavors. But consumers should understand that the alcohol is 16.7%. It's a great example of a superripe Sonoma Zin, but be careful to not drink too much.",87,38,California,Rockpile,Zinfandel
US,"This Zinfandel's tannins are starting to resolve, which gives the palate a soft, melted quality. The primary flavors are transforming into rich, dried black-raspberry and cherry notes, with leather, mocha, dried mushroom and spice accents.",90,28,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel

US,"Thistle consistently produces one of Oregon's best Pinot Blancs. This is creamy and fresh, bursting with ripe pear and melon, and streaked with a gentle hint of coconut and vanilla. The lush finish seems to carry on for a full minute or longer.",91,18,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Pinot Blanc
US,"Thomas Fogarty's Bordeaux project unleashes aromas of black pepper, Bing cherry and cedar in this wine that proves light, airy and vivacious. Flavors of black and sour cherry dominate the acid-driven palate, which picks up more pepper and is quite easy going down.",88,45,California,Santa Cruz Mountains,Cabernet Franc
US,"Those notorious mountain tannins have largely melted, making the wine drinkable now, although it will hold for a decade with proper cellaring. Lush and velvety, with a drop of Cabernet Franc, this is voluptuous in cherries, black currants and fine, toasty oak.",94,70,California,Howell Mountain,Merlot
US,"Those used to the fabulous richness of Ed Sbragia's Chardonnays at Beringer might find this disappointing. It's a good wine, with the Burgundian formula of half-barrel fermention in new oak, malolactic fermentation and weekly lees stirring, so it has those winemaker-added notes of creamy, yeasty smokiness. Yet the underlying pear and apple flavors are a little thin.",86,26,California,Dry Creek Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Those who think they prefer anything but Chardonnay may be convinced otherwise with this wine. It is so powerfully evocative in crisply rendered Meyer lemon and tangerine notes, with aromas of fresh white flowers teasing provocatively on the nose. Seamless and seductively bright in acidity, it glides down the palate, hinting at a richness that never becomes overdone.",96,65,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Though a reserve bottling, this shows a very fresh and sprightly side of the grape rather than its dense face. Squeezed blackberries, just-picked thyme and a touch of burnt caramel show on the nose, while the palate offers Concord grape, boysenberry and iced-coffee flavors.",88,55,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Though aged in neutral oak, this wine opens with scents and flavor hints of toast and butter. The fruit is clean and generic, like a fresh apple, but the mouthfeel lacks life and fades into a flat finish. Drink up.",87,35,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Though billed as a red blend, this is made from 98% Merlot and does justice to the variety. Complete on the entry in ripe fruit, it offers dusty cedar, graphite and oak elements within a cool-climate sensibility of savory grace and balance.",92,110,California,Oak Knoll District,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Though Cabernets Sauvignon and Franc each make up just 3% of this wine, they seem to show themselves aromatically, with herb and floral notes that provide the backdrop for Merlot's cocoa and cherry. The red fruit flavors are plump and juicy, backed by bright acid that leads to a long, fruit filled finish. It doesn't always come off as completely varietal but it's nearly impossible to resist all the same.",91,40,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"Though designated simply as Washington state, this five grape, Cab-dominated, Bordeaux-style blend is sourced entirely from Kiona's Red Mountain vineyards. Aromatic‚Äîalmost pungent‚Äîit's built around soft, ripe red fruits, augmented with a touch of leather and toast. Round, full, and ready to drink, it spent a year in 60% new oak.",90,25,Washington,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Though found in some Chardonnays, there's a heaviness to this wine, with its orange Muscat nose and syrupy flavors, that seems out of sync here. The wine seems to flop onto the palate and sit there, without much progression. Needs more acid and a lighter touch.",82,20,New York,Finger Lakes,Chardonnay
US,"Though it's 100% Merlot from Red Mountain, this seems more generic than representative of what that AVA can produce. It could be any modestly priced Bordeaux red variety or blend‚Äîred fruits, stiff tannins, and a seamless, yet one-dimensional mouthfeel.",86,30,Washington,Red Mountain,Merlot
US,"Though it's a huge tannic monster right now, this Bordeaux blend, a first release and new brand name from Steven Kent Winery, is an ode to Steven Kent Mirassou's family's long lineage in California winemaking and the roots of Livermore's history in wine as well. A majority Cabernet (75%), with all the lush cassis and black cherry one would hope for, the wine shows nicely honed herbal notes from its 15% Cab Franc in the middle, with a little touch of spice on the finish coming from 5% Petit Verdot (3% Malbec and 2% Merlot round out the blend). Give this one time and it will surely reward.",94,125,California,Livermore Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Though it's a niche variety in the state, Carmen√®re has always been a flagship wine for this winery. This one is all varietal, with aromas of herbs, freshly cut green and jalape√±o peppers. It coats the palate with dark fruit and savory flavors.",91,51,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Carmen√®re
US,"Though labeled as Merlot, this smells more like Syrah which makes up 20% of the blend, with aromas of blue and purple fruit along with whiffs of smoked meat and dried herb. The fruit flavors are sweet and plump, backed by soft, luxurious tannins. It's enjoyable but doesn't seem varietally correct.",87,12,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot

US,"Though labeled Columbia Valley, this is in fact 100% Merlot from the estate vineyards on Red Mountain. It's chewy and tannic, as is often the case with Red Mountain reds, with black cherry and cassis fruit wrapped by astringent tannins hinting at dark chocolate. In short, a fine steak wine, that needs some fat to cut the tannins.",89,25,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Merlot

US,"Though labeled reserve, this is barely distinguishable from the winery's regular Cabernet. More toast, and a little chocolate is showing, but the fruit flavors‚Äîpale blackberry and black currant‚Äîare quickly covered up by the aggressive tannins.",85,32,Washington,Yakima Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Though labeled simply Columbia Valley, the grapes are single vineyard, Rattlesnake Hills AVA fruit. The best of the Girly Girl lineup, though the promising beginning (cassis and berry, scented with black olive and herb) quickly fades into a forest floor finale of decaying leaves.",85,19,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Though labeled simply Washington state, this Bordeaux-style blend is sourced entirely from Kiona's Red Mountain vineyards. The wine includes 20% Cabernet Franc and 5% Petit Verdot, yielding a deep, darkly fruited wine with cassis, black coffee, graphite and a whiff of barnyard. It's young, tight and chewy, but has excellent aging potential.",89,25,Washington,Washington,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Though labeled sweet, this has just enough acidity to feel off-dry in the mouth. It brings a mix of pear and peach, apple and orange peel flavors, which fade rather quickly into a flat finish.",83,15,Washington,Lake Chelan,Riesling
US,"Though light in color, this flagrantly floral expression of the variety offers a cr√®me br√ªl√©e-like richness on the nose. The palate is a different story‚Äîall tart fruit, lifted acidity and gravelly minerality.",90,42,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
US,"Though low in alcohol even by David Hill standards, this excellent Pinot Gris does not lack fruit or flavor. Ripe and tasting of pretty pear and orange fruit, it shows evidence of some well-balanced residual sugar. Vivid acidity cuts through to a satisfying finish.",91,17,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"Though no new oak was used in the √©l√©vage of this wine, it has a lovely, toasty backdrop to the aromas of fresh rose petals, spicy tobacco and tart plum. This is nicely rounded, keeping the acids from dominating and allowing the fruit to display itself gently and without any rough edges. In the mouth the acids come forward, but they are so fresh, natural and clean that it's a genuine pleasure.",88,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Sangiovese
US,"Though no residual sugar is listed, this appears to have a hint of sweetness, along with light fruit flavors of strawberry and candied cherries.",86,18,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Pinot Gris
US,"Though not as powerful and concentrated as the Spofford Station Syrah, this wine displays the same distinctive, complex flavor palette‚Äîa mix of earth, herb, compost, fungus, smoke, rock and, oh yeah, baby, oodles of fruit. This sort of flavor profile is similar to the biodynamic wines of Cayuse, but at half the cost.",92,36,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"Though not designated, the grapes for this white come from the Dutton Sullivan Vineyard, outside of Graton, planted to a heritage selection of Wente. Wet stone and salty apple make for an inviting beginning, followed by a length of complex Mandarin orange specked in spice. Andrew Berge is the winemaker.",92,38,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Though not labeled as such, this is truly a Red Mountain wine with all of the fruit coming from Ciel du Cheval and Taptiel vineyards. A blend of Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Petit Verdot, it shows a mixture of fruit and barrel. Flavors of herbs, plum, oak spices and black currant offer impressive density and finish with a tart lick of acidity.",92,55,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Though not treating the grape with quite the same reverence as other varieties, Central Coast vintners are having fun with Merlot, making quaffable, easygoing bottlings like this one. It shows caramelized blueberry, black currant and asphalt touches on the nose. The graphite minerality also pops on the palate, giving a tension to the cassis flavors.",88,28,California,Central Coast,Merlot
US,"Though picked at 23.6 brix, this Riesling reaches 14% alcohol and 1% residual sugar, an interesting combination of data. It's plenty concentrated, with a flavor mix of flower, sugar, honey and peach. A mouthful to be sure, substantial and packed with flavor, though a little heavy through the finish.",87,25,Oregon,Eola-Amity Hills,Riesling
US,"Though reserved on the nose at first, this bottling begins to show dense blueberry, coffee and soy with patience. There are boisterous flavors of squeezed elderberry and blackberry fruit once sipped, along with beef char, black coffee, dark chocolate and purple flowers on the finish. This still needs a little time to open, but shows lots of potential.",89,65,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Though sourced principally from Red Mountain grapes, where the Col Solare winery is located, this Cab-dominated Bordeaux-style blend is simply labeled Columbia Valley. It's a user-friendly wine with plump cherry fruit and notes of tobacco, licorice and vanilla. Soft and supple and ready to drink.",88,45,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"Though the alcohol lists at 14.3%, this seems thin and flat. There's little depth to the one-dimensional, green fruit flavors, a hint of plastic and some burn in the finish.",84,18,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Viognier
US,"Though the flavors are one dimensional, they are substantial, with a mix of plum and black-cherry fruit at the center. There are strong streaks of citrus and soil, with astringent tannins and acids that stick out with a somewhat chalky, citrus character.",86,48,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Though the vineyard sources‚ÄîStillwater and Conner Lee‚Äîare first-rate, this wine seems a bit disjointed at the moment. Sweet, juicy fruit opens up into a midpalate that seems to have a hole, and then the aggressive flavors of vanilla surface. The vanilla-tinged finish feels tacked on, though perhaps some further bottle age will help to smooth it.",87,50,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Though this is pure Cabernet from an excellent Walla Walla vineyard, the flavors seem rather harsh and quite astringent. The dark fruit is cloaked in bitter, chalky tannins that require some rich food to cut through.",86,32,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"Though this wine was aged in just 26% new oak (French and American), the wood makes the first impression. Aromas of caramel, coffee and vanilla extract fare are followed by dark fruit and spices. Flavors are rich, hedonistic and sweet, supported by firm, somewhat rustic tannins.",89,30,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Tempranillo
US,"Three excellent vineyards‚ÄîStonetree, Bacchus and Minnick Hills‚Äîcontribute to this firmly-built Cabernet Franc. Fine tannins, a light touch of barrel toast and a hint of dark chocolate surround tart blackberry and cassis fruit. A lick of caramel comes out in the finish. Not a big wine, but exceptionally well-balanced.",89,42,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Franc
US,"Three months in stainless steel result in a very pale wine with aromas of lemon peel and grapefruit flesh. The palate is painted with bright, citrus zest acidity throughout, yet retains the varietal's flavors of nectarine flesh and yellow melons. It makes a leading option for the unoaked crowd.",88,22,California,Monterey,Chardonnay
US,"Three quarters Merlot, with 17% Cabernet Franc and 8% Cabernet Sauvignon, this is a bit lighter than the 2007 Merlot, but just as good, if not better. Lush and loaded with black cherry, blackberry, cocoa and baking spices, it extends deliciously and seamlessly into a long, ripe, smooth finish.",92,28,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Merlot
US,"Three things characterize this wine: exceptionally intense blackberry and currant flavors, thick, hard tannins and a bone dry finish. It's big and firm with a lot of promise, so do try to cellar it for at least six years, but people who like their wines young could try it sooner.",92,80,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Three vineyards contribute to this lovely wine, two in Rutherford, both certified organic, and another in Soda Canyon which is at 800-feet in elevation. Red and blue fruit open for leather and a touch of cedar and dried herb‚Äîthe wine ultimately elegant and Old World. The tannin weight is substantial but never distracting.",91,75,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Three-fifths Merlot, one quarter Cab Franc and the rest Cabernet Sauvignon, this Bordeaux-style blend shows ripe fruit scents of raisin and prune, offset with baking spices and plenty of chocolate and espresso. Full-throttle, smooth and concentrated, it's a big, concentrated, somewhat in-your face-effort, but delicious all the way through.",91,42,Washington,Yakima Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Tight and focused, this has a fine core of black cherry and cassis. Layers of coffee and dark chocolate are wrapped around the fruit, and the wine is compact and textural. Excellent now, but probably better in a few years.",90,17,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tight and nicely constructed, this is not afraid to show its herbal side. Tannins are earthy and firm, the fruit tight and focused, and the wine might benefit from a few more years in the bottle.

US,"Tight in elegant raspberry and cassis fruit, this small-production Cabernet is on the cool-climate side of the equation, reflective of the vintage. Tastes of black and bell peppers are interspersed with cedar, and the finish is purely oak.",87,80,California,Livermore Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"Tighter blackberry and blueberry fruits meet with a touch of fennel on this nose of this appellation blend by Billy Wathen and Dick Dore. Flavors range from refreshing blackberry soda to root beer and cola, achieving a measure of elegance thanks to dill, tomato leaf and a tannic grip.",89,38,California,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tightly structured in a ripe, bold bundle of cherry and berry flavors, this is an intensely tannic and youthful wine, clearly indicative of the vintage. Sage, dried herb, marshmallow and toasted oak aromas round it out, giving it flavor beyond its innate concentration.",91,85,California,Oakville,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tightly tannic, this 100% varietal wine comes from the producer's family estate. It's big in blackberry fruit and oak, the tannins generous on the palate.

US,"To call this anything other than modern in style would be incorrect. It's soft and silky and direct in blackberry and cherry jam, chocolate and caramel flavors, although the finish is technically dry. Delicious and fancy, and will appeal to fans of ripe, sweet fruit, but it doesn't have the structure for aging.",90,95,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"To call this Cabernet muscular is an understatement. It's a mixed martial arts wine that kicks butt and takes no prisoners.

US,"Toasty, with a bit of cedar or menthol on the nose; red berries and licorice on the palate. The fruit here is delicate and tart, particularly on the finish, where the flavors are almost lemony.",84,18,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tobacco and some green pepper on an otherwise fruity plain. When you think of cru bourgeois Bordeaux, this fits the image and flavor profile. It's lean, but balanced. Tea and licorice are definable on the finish.",88,35,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tolosa may be the only vineyard to produce two unoaked Chardonnays in the same vintage. Their '11 Central Coast is quite good. This one, from estate Edna Valley fruit, is even better. With keen acidity and a brisk minerality, it shows complex flavors of limes, kiwis and grapefruits, and hints of riper, richer tropical fruits.",90,34,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Tom Meadowcroft's second label, Thomas Henry, is also sourcing from Borden Ranch in Lodi, as is his slightly higher-priced, lower-alcohol Riesling under the Meadowcroft name. This one not as as fragrant at first, more austere, but fully inviting wih melon, honey and pear. Thai food would be the perfect pairing.",88,26,California,Lodi,Riesling
US,"Tonella has 16% Merlot within, from the estate vineyard around the winery. Cedar, currant and dried herb greet the nose and palate before allowing chalky, dusty tannin to season layers of chocolate and black cherry, staying structured and bright from start to finish.",90,90,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tones of black cherry and cassis are pure and pristine on this fresh, herb-infused Cabernet. Vibrant acidity and soft, furry tannins on the midpalate give way to a finish that's flecked with spice and menthol.",86,26,Colorado,Grand Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Tons of candied grape and lilac aromas show on the nose of this rather aged blend of 60% Grenache, 30% Syrah and 10% Mourv√®dre, with root beer and blueberry-sorbet notes. The palate offers a similar array of sweet dark fruit, but the tannic structure and acidity clean it up nicely.",88,25,California,Paso Robles,G-S-M
US,"Tons of spice notes entertain the nose on this bottling, from white pepper and dill to sandalwood and incense, all against a cranberry-fruit backdrop. The palate, framed by an impressive though not oppressive structure, shows a touch of pasilla chile and black pepper before riper boysenberry and cranberry arise in the midpalate. Rose petals, pencil lead, thyme and oregano add nuance.",92,26,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Cabernet Franc
US,"Too bad the vineyard owner is pulling out the Sauvignon Blanc, because this is a fresh, vibrant, juicy one, crisp in acidity and rich in citrus, figs, pears and melons. Just a touch of tart gooseberry shows up in the finish.",89,22,California,Anderson Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Too heavy for a ros√©, with black cherry, cola and leather flavors that lack the delicacy and zest you want in a blush wine.",84,23,California,Rutherford,Sangiovese
US,"Too hot and sweet, this Zin weighs in at 16.2% of alcohol. It has blackberry and cocoa flavors spiced with chile peppers.",82,19,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel

US,"Too soft, lacking vital structure, and too sweet for a dry table wine. Shows candied flavors of berries and cherries.",82,18,California,Cienega Valley,Sangiovese
US,"Too strong and extracted in blackberry and cherry fruit, almost like pure jam, a sweet, candied impression that the caramel of new oak compounds. Feels like the winemaker tried too hard to make it flashy. Pretty good, but could use restraint and finesse.",87,48,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Too sweet and oaky, with sugary vanilla and pineapple jam flavors. Could be a Starbucks drink. Saved a bit by crisp acidity.",84,20,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay

US,"Totally unusual and totally fun, this dark amber-colored wine is unexpected. It smells like flowers and honey, as if it will be sweet, but tastes dry and tangy, like blood oranges and raspberries. It's medium bodied and has a slight tannic or astringent finish, so it should pair well with toasted nut and cheeses.",90,26,California,Anderson Valley,Pinot Gris
US,Touches of ginger and orange zest lighten up the ample fruit flavors of this well-balanced value-priced wine. It has good acidity to match the ripeness of the Anjou pear and white peach flavors.,87,8,California,California,Chardonnay
US,"Touches of sage and tarragon breathe freshness into succulent red cherry and berry aromas on this rich, full-bodied Cabernet Franc. The palate shows off pure, pristine red fruit, jolted by a shock of cranberry acidity and a lingering wet-granite finish.",90,20,New York,Finger Lakes,Cabernet Franc
US,"Tough and tannic now, although it's fully dry, and the tannins are finely sculpted. Shows deep flavors of blackberries, currants, cocoa and spices. There's a hint of funkiness that may detract from ageability.",85,49,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"Tough, dry and gritty, with astringent tannins framing black cherry and oak flavors. Finishes hot, with a scour of alcohol. Lacks elegance and breed. Drink up.",85,40,California,Russian River Valley,Cabernet Franc
US,"Tranche is exploring lesser-known (for Walla Walla) grapes such as this Tempranillo, producing wines with structure and depth. Blueberry fruit and a big wash of roasted coffee ground flavors are here, with dry, firm tannins. The length is impressive.",90,30,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Tempranillo
US,"Trebbiano is a workhorse Italian variety that will never achieve noble status, like Chardonnay, but in the right hands can be the perfect dry white wine. Cinnabar has done a great job. The wine is crisp and floral, with citrus, honeysuckle and spice flavors lightly touched by oak. Try with tempura dipped in soy sauce.",87,25,California,Paso Robles,Trebbiano
US,"Tremendously sweet in blackberry, chocolate and vanilla oak flavors, with a fine bite of acidity. It's a satisfying dessert wine for drinking with chocolate, or try pecan pie, but it would score far higher if it were richer.",88,32,California,California,Port
US,"Trine, named for the three main partners at Pepper Bridge winery, is predominantly equal parts Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, with a final 12% of the blend divvied up among the other three Bordeaux red grapes.

But despite so many good traits, it has less concentration than most wines in its price category.",89,60,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Troon is going all in on Tannat, and this latest release‚Äîall estate-grown‚Äîmarks a dive into natural winemaking. That means hand-picked, foot-stomped, native yeast and no additions during fermentation. Smooth, almost burnished to a fine gloss, this has dense fruit flavors of blueberry, boysenberry and blackberry. A dark streak of espresso, graphite and charcoal adds extra weight and length.",90,35,Oregon,Applegate Valley,Tannat

US,"Tropical peach fuzz, grassiness and acidity give this wine a lively edge, supported by ample freshness on the palate, as well as length and body. A touch sour on the finish, it begs for just-caught seafood.",87,30,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Tropical ripeness shows strong on the nose of this wine, which is made from the Musque clone out of the Carter Estate Vineyard. It shows aromas of Juicy Fruit gum, papaya-orange-guava juice and daffodils. The palate offers a honeyed red-apple flavor.",86,16,California,Temecula Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Tropical vanilla and pineapple notes provide this full-bodied wine with voluptuous fruit and texture. That ripeness finds its equilibrium on the midpalate, settling down into lemon peel and quince highlights that finish bright.",90,45,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"Tropicality rules the roost on this wine, which offers peach, papaya, apricot, mango, coconut and even banana aromas on the nose. Ripe apples, cherimoya and poached peach show on the palate. It's all a little bit much, but not overdone, with enough restraint to achieve balance.",88,29,California,Happy Canyon of Santa Barbara,Viognier
US,"Truchard has produced a Roussanne for many years, but the quality seems to vary according to vintage. The 2012 is a very good wine. It's dry, yet honeyed, with orange, peach and white-flower flavors. The texture is creamy, but highlighted with brisk acidity. It would be a great accompaniment to rich, complex dishes, but a simple roasted chicken would be wonderful as well.",91,25,California,Carneros,Roussanne
US,"True to its advocacy for Malbec in the Napa Valley, the producer adds 15% Malbec to this Cabernet Sauvignon, forging a dark, rich and intense wine that's generous in black fruit and tobacco. It nonetheless retains ample acidity to stay balanced and rewarding on the palate. Enjoy through 2020.",91,60,California,Mount Veeder,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"True to its name, this wine is a rowdy mashup. It has an earthy, smoky aroma, cherry flavors shaded by leathery funkiness, and a smooth easy-drinking texture.",84,12,California,California,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"True to the Pride style, this Chardonnay is massively constructed, with an enormous blast of pineapple, orange and golden mango fruit, elaborated with sweet, smoky, caramelized oak. It's saved from being a mere fruit bomb by crisp acidity and a bracing minerality. Drink now for sheer hedonistic freshness.",93,47,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay

US,"Truly stunning, the Lewis Estate Riesling from Dunham explodes with fragrant fruits‚Äîcitrus, melon and tropical. A symphony of subtle accents, such as powdered sugar, candied citrus peel and breakfast tea, this gorgeous bottle belongs with the short list of the very best of Washington's many Rieslings.",95,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Riesling
US,"Try sneaking this into your next wine group blind tasting. It might turn some heads. It shows the ripe, polished cherry, plum, sage, carob and licorice flavors of the finest Merlots, with rich, finely ground tannins, and finishes dry. With a drop of Cabs Sauvignon and Franc, it has true complexity.",87,15,California,Sonoma County,Merlot

US,"Tulpen's 2009 Cabernet moves the fruit sources to a trio of Walla Walla vineyards, notably Tokar and Heather Hill, to good effect. It's pure varietal, and the excellent fruit sources yield a muscular, aromatic, dense wine. Floral top notes lead into spicy, brambly black fruits. The tannins are firm and astringent, leaving just a bare suggestion of ripe raisins in the finish.",91,38,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Twenty-five percent new oak shows in the aromas of buttered toast, butterscotch and caramel that superimpose over ripe notes of pineapple jam. Purists might object to all that oak, but others will go gaga.",89,25,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay
US,Twin unbalanced notes of vegetables and raisins mar this Cabernet. It's very soft and finishes with notes of prunes and milk chocolate.,82,19,California,Paso Robles,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Two different Tempranillo clones are aged in 100% American oak. This pure, varietal wine offers warm, light red fruits and flavors of the barrels‚Äîhints of pickle barrel spice, along with whiffs of smoke and cured meats.",89,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Tempranillo
US,"Two Dijon clones went into this tasty Chardonnay, which is rounded out and easily accessible upon opening. Smooth tree-fruit flavors are set in a lightly buttery frame, with nutmeg spice. As it rolls along the impression of fresh-baked brioche is undeniable. Delicious and ready to enjoy immediately, this should hold up in the cellar through 2021 or so.",91,35,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Typical of the variety, this shows upfront aromas of fresh green pepper, eucalyptus, black pepper and blackberry. These notes are amplified on the palate, with cedar and earthiness adding dimension. The tannins are not shy, but are well-integrated and the acidity is zippy and playful, which lends to a long, enticing finish.",88,25,Virginia,Virginia,Cabernet Franc
US,"Ultra-rich, with chocolate-infused dark berry flavors, splashed with cassis and accented with smoky new oak.

US,"Uncomplicated yet tasty, this medium-bodied, mild-textured wine has a pure raspberry/strawberry character from the bright aroma to the ripe flavors to the lingering finish. The balance is on the soft side due to low acidity and little astringency from tannins.",87,20,California,Mendocino,Zinfandel
US,"Unctuous, with a profound sense of the salty sea, this wine is both rich and bright, balanced between crisp, defined acidity and complex depth of flavor. Lemon verbena and quince compete against a more nuanced, satisfying bite of caramelized pear as the finish refreshes.",93,42,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"Under the Feather label, this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon styled by Napa's Randy Dunn s the only one pure varietal red wine in the Long Shadows collection. Eucalyptus aromas rise instantly as it's poured, leading into a smooth, appealing flavors of plum and cassis fruit. It fades rather quickly, even after being open for a few hours, leaving just an impression of chocolate from the barrel aging. It lacks the heft of past vintages.",89,60,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Underripe lemons, yellow roses, cut apples and white lilies are bolstered by an intriguing, light cinnamon spice on the nose of this bottling. It's a bit like sipping on honeysuckle tea, as the palate is sizzling with acidity and packed with flavors of lemon oil, green apple skins and tangerine rinds.",92,25,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay

US,"Underripe, slightly green orange peels mix with honeydew, grass and lime on this straightforward selection. The palate shows a touch of peach on the first part of the sip before delving into pungent grassiness that continues through the finish, all complemented by a wet stone frame.",90,24,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Ungainly, with stiff, puckery tannins giving a hard astringency, and unintegrated oak sticking out. Somewhere inbetween are modest cherry, anise and herb flavors. Pretty good, but not likely to go anywhere, so drink now.",86,35,California,Oakville,Merlot
US,"Unless you just love oak, this one is way too woody. Buttered toast, creamed corn and popcorn aromas are seconded on the palate by thick, cloying buttery flavors and very little fruit. Not appealing.",82,16,California,Santa Ynez Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Unless you knew that this was Dominus and had tasted older vintages, you might not be impressed. In its youth the wine is tannic and dry and linear. However, it is Dominus and it does need cellaring. Right now it shows blackberry, black currant, cedar and baker's chocolate flavors. Will slowly open and reach maturity after 2011, and could easily develop for far longer.",93,99,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Unmistakably Riesling from the petrol notes that dominates. The winemaker calls it off-dry, but it tastes dry in citrus, white flower and mineral notes, probably due  to the high acidity. Refreshingly low in alcohol.",88,25,California,Arroyo Seco,Riesling
US,"Unoaked Chardonnays can be fairly neutral, but this one is anything but. Creamy and textural, it's laced with mixed flavors of grapefruit, gooseberry, lime and lemon zest. Delicious on its own, or pair it with gently seasoned seafood or poultry.",88,10,Oregon,Oregon,Chardonnay
US,"Unripe, with strong lemongrass, green pea and feline spray flavors accompanying more pleasant lemons and limes. Acidity is strong, and the wine is totally dry.",84,22,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Unusual, high-toned aromas of green herbs, fresh flowers and pomegranate lead to smooth cherry and orange-peel flavors with abundant floral notes throughout. It provides lots of easy-drinking pleasure, though the floral notes at times seem overpowering.",88,15,Washington,Yakima Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Unusually blended from all five Bordeaux varieties with Malbec dominating, this is a wonderfully, rich, complex wine. It shows jammy blackberry and plum flavors, with spice and cocoa overtones and firm, ripe tannins. The finish is dry and long. An impressive introductory wine from Trefethen, off the estate vineyard.",94,75,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Unusually fruity for a Pinot Gris, this bursts with quince, hay and lanolin aromas that give way to an intense palate with good weight. While slightly astringent, the mouthwatering finish will provide a good foil for fried calamari.",88,16,New York,Finger Lakes,Pinot Gris
US,"Upfront aromas of buttered dinner rolls‚Äîwhich take on a caramel quality with long sniff‚Äîcontrast nicely with lime edges.

US,"Uplifting aromatics of blackberry soda and purple flowers provide a nose that could be sniffed all day, hinting at a fun but elegant GSM. The flavors fall in line, with cola, Bing cherries and rose water combining for a light, floral palate, yet with green tea tannins and tartness to keep it grounded.",93,34,California,Central Coast,G-S-M
US,"Upon opening, this intense, fragrant wine seems European in style, with Italian-like nuances of leather, fungus and tobacco. The enticing whiffs give way to a full-flavored palate that offers notes of mixed red fruits, while the finish loses some focus.",89,35,Washington,Red Mountain,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Uriah is Spring Valley's Right Bank-style blend, with Merlot and Cabernet Franc sharing the lead. It's lively and fine-tuned, with a lovely mix of red fruits, spices, and fresh acidity.

US,"Using fruit mostly from the Bassi Ranch property he recently acquired, Mike Sinor delivers a bright, minerally wine, with aromas of scratched grapefruit skin, orange and peach juice, burned lemons, sea salt, ripe apples and nectarines and fresh-cut herbs.

US,"Using Grenache sourced from the moderately cool Lonesome Springs Vineyard, this is slightly leafy, with notes of forest floor, blueberry and blackberry.

It's a very good example of how this grape variety thrives in Lake County.",90,18,California,Lake County,Sauvignon Blanc

US,"Very aromatic, with an elusive note of violets that adds to the attractions of the blackberries, briary wild cherries, licorice and black pepper. Full bodied and dry, this Zin is charmingly sweet in fruit and brown butter on the finish.",90,24,California,El Dorado,Zinfandel
US,"Very bright and acidic, with the savory taste of a sour lemondrop candy. If you're sensitive to acidity you'll find it tart. But it's deliciously layered, with tiers of buttered toast, vanilla and spice.",87,20,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay

US,"Very Chablis-like, this coastal Chardonnay has high acidity that makes it clean and vibrant. The flavors are marked by minerals and Meyer lemons, with a touch of smoky oak. It's a fine, dry white wine that will pair well with a wide range of foods, and it's from Francis Ford Coppola.",87,21,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
US,"Very clear in the glass, this bottling from the Wrath team shows honeydew, passionfruit, pine needle and a hint of wood on the nose. The flavors are straightforward, with green-apple flesh and a hint of more passionfruit.",88,19,California,Monterey,Sauvignon Blanc

US,"Very dark, rich and dramatic. Massively constructed, with vast reserves of blackberry jam, blackstrap molasses, mocha, smoked meat, mushu plum sauce and sweet, smoky oak.

US,"Very dark-purple fruit meet with crushed black rocks, dense purple flowers and roasted beef on the nose of this lush and delicious bottling, which is bolstered by bits of Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Malbec. Soft black cherry, caramel and vanilla flavors coat the palate, with slate, cocoa, espresso bean and graham cracker touches.",94,48,California,El Pomar District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Very delicious and luscious, but no mere fruit bomb. It has the tannic-acidic structure and dryness to make it refined, but explodes on the palate with blackberry, chocolate, cassis, anise and sweet, smoky cedar flavors that are deep and long. Tastes important and first rate.",94,110,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend

US,"Very dry and rather sharp in fruit-skin acidity, with a tart bite to the cherries, cola and licorice. A good, rustic wine for drinking now.",84,25,California,Paso Robles,G-S-M
US,"Very dry and tannic, a style of Cabernet that relies more on structure than flash. Despite fairly high alcohol, it keeps a tight rein on the blackberries and cedar, locking the flavors in astringency. Needs time. Give it until 2013 and see where it goes.",90,48,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

US,"Very dry, a lean, austere Chardonnay currently marked by aloof flavors of lemons, limes and oak. Yet there's something going on. As the wine warms in the glass it becomes richer, showing hidden pineapple tart, macadamia and cr√®me br√ªl√©e. Firm, minerally acidity is there throughout, making for a mouthwatering cleanliness. Drink this streamlined, Chablis-like wine now‚Äì2013.",92,60,California,Napa County,Chardonnay
US,"Very dry, crisp and minerally, a subtle wine with some bottle age that shows real complexity and finesse.

Drink right away, before it dies.",90,35,California,Sonoma Valley,Chardonnay

US,"Very focused and deep aromas of boysenberry, violet, rose petal and anise make for a heady rich entry into this Grenache.

US,"Very limited, this is a relatively new project from second generation winemaker Jason Lett. It is sourced from ‚Äúthe oldest vines in the Willamette Valley‚Äù‚Äîpresumably Eyrie vines planted in 1965, and finds similar territory as the Eyrie reserve, with a bit more richness through the midpalate, partly from more expressive barrel flavors.",92,63,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Chardonnay
US,"Very much in the vein of a super-oaked, ripe Chardonnay, bursting with peach and tropical aromas and flavors, but with a distinctly nutty, minerally, almost steely note and an electric jolt of acidity. Judging from the very long, sweet finish, it's got quite a life ahead of it.",91,24,California,Chalone,Pinot Blanc

US,"Very oaky, very buttery, very posh in texture, this wine takes the spicy richness of oak-barrel fermentation and aging to a high level.

US,"Very opulent and jammy in blackberry, cherry and mocha flavors, this has a strong oak presence in the form of caramelized wood. It defines Napa richness, but it is too tannic and immature to properly enjoy now. Give it a snooze for 6‚Äì8 years.",92,75,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Very pale, almost transparent, despite alcohol over 14% abv, this very light, citrusy wine carries a background flavor of vitamin pill, and feels a bit flat in the mouth.",83,19,Oregon,Rogue Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Very powerful, very strong, almost overwhelming in the sheer wealth of fruit and oak, but balanced with acidity. Winemaker Bob Cabral himself calls it ‚Äúconcentrated.‚Äù It detonates on the palate with an almost dessert wine quality of lemons, pineapples, honey, vanilla and minerals, but it's totally dry. Will hold for perhaps six years.",95,50,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Very primary aromas of lime zest and mineral are followed by lightly spritzy, just a hair off-dry citrus flavors backed by bright, tart acidity.",89,18,Washington,Ancient Lakes,Riesling

US,"Very rich and smooth in texture, like pure velvet, this Bordeaux-style blend has lots of tannins that are soft, ripe and easy. It offers extraordinary waves of blackberry, black currant, dark chocolate and caramelized oak flavors. Drink soon for maximum enjoyment.",93,75,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Very rich and voluptuous, this has ripe blackberry fruit that has a roasted character, as if the berries spent a moment on the grill. It's deep and impressive, showing tiers of complexity, but it's also very tannic, with a dry, astringent kick that makes it seemingly undrinkable now. Made from mostly Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc, with a drop of Petit Verdot, it's a wine that needs considerable time in the cellar. Hold until after 2018.",94,125,California,Oakville,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Very rich in oak, with massive buttered toast, caramel and cr√®me br√ªl√©e flavors. The underlying fruit is good, suggesting pineapples and ripe peaches, but misses a beat for all that winemaker intervention. Drink now.",88,56,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Very rich in texture and lightly sweet in flavor, this wine smells citrusy and crisp but tastes full and soft. It has ripe pear and peach flavors and a lingering, honey-like finish.",87,25,California,Lake County,Chardonnay
US,"Very rich, creamy and oaky, made in the ripe, California style of Chardonnay. Brims with buttered toast, vanilla cream, and caramelized wood aromas and flavors riding over underlying pineapples, pears and limes. Flamboyant, if a little top-heavy. Ready now.",88,38,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Very rich, extracted and soft in tannins and acids, a melt-in-your-mouth Zin with almost sweet flavors of milk chocolate, crushed ripe cherries, licorice, caramelized wood and oodles of black pepper. Should develop over the next 4‚Äì6 years.",88,40,California,Alexander Valley,Zinfandel
US,"Very rich, ripe and dry, a Merlot with a drop of Cabernet that needs a year or two to resolve. It's fat and fleshy in cherries, violets, red currants and cola, with a dusting of cocoa, pepper and cinnamon. The tannins are ample, but very finely ground. Hold until 2011.",90,28,California,Sonoma County,Merlot
US,"Very rich, ripe and oaky, but something of a fruit-oak bomb. Blasts the palate with pineapple jam, toasty meringue, caramel and buttered toast aromas and flavors. Lacks subtlety.",86,36,California,Carneros,Chardonnay
US,"Very rich, with freshly crushed pineapple, grilled ripe peach, buttered toast and caramelized vanilla cream flavors. Could have greater structure, as it's a little soft for all that weight, but it's a fancy Chardonnay.",87,46,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay

US,"Very ripe and oaky, what this wine may lack in subtlety it makes up for in sheer power. Bursts with ripe, candied pineapple and lemon honey flavors that finish sweet.",85,25,California,Napa Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Very ripe and oaky. Bursts with pineapple pie filling, tapioca, butterscotch and caramel flavors. Could use some complexity and restraint.",84,22,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Very ripe and soft, this has blackberry, plum and chocolate flavors that veer toward prune and raisin territory. It's dry, spicy and a little hot, but is a great example of a warm-climate Zin at the highest level.",90,45,California,Calistoga,Zinfandel
US,"Very ripe and spicy, with a sprinkle of dusty Christmas spices tanging up the wild cherry, raspberry, licorice and Dr. Pepper cola flavors. Zin doesn't get much richer, but this one could be a little firmer in structure. Drink now.",88,45,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
US,"Very ripe flavors make this wine seem almost sweet and the rich texture coats the mouth, augmenting the syrupy impression. Flavors suggest plump raspberries and fresh blackberries, while the finish brings out milk chocolate.",89,19,California,Mendocino County,Grenache
US,"Very ripe fruit aromas and flavors in this wine resemble dried plums and cherries. The texture feels broad and smooth, with enough firm tannins to give it some grip on the palate. It tastes full bodied and a bit exotic, with some anise and black pepper to enhance the dried-fruit notes.",86,52,California,Livermore Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Very ripe in aroma, almost thick in texture and syrupy in flavor, this wine is full bodied, super fruity and smooth.",87,17,California,Lodi,Zinfandel

US,"Very ripe in the modern style, with masses of jammy blackberries, black currants and black cherries and uplifted, smoky notes of oak. The tannins are thick and astringent. One defect is a certain sharpness that lasts through the finish and makes the mouthfeel tart.",87,49,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Very ripe, rich and new-oaky, with dazzling flavors of ripe pineapples, pears, limes, caramel and buttered toast, drizzled with vanilla honey. A crowd-pleasing Chardonnay of enormous power and concentration. Could use a touch more nuance and complexity, but a tremendous wine at a good price for the quality.",93,30,California,Santa Barbara County,Chardonnay

US,"Very similar to Peju's regular '05 Cab Franc, released a few months earlier, except it tastes much oakier. You'll find the soft structure and cherry, currant and violet flavors, but the toasty oak and caramel are overwhelming.",87,95,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Franc

It's full bodied, soft and concentrated.",90,27,California,Sierra Foothills,Chardonnay
US,"Very smooth, yet mouth-drying with firm tannins, this Cabernet is a bit lean, but it defines the elegance that Napa is capable of. The blackberry and currant flavors are balanced by earthier notes of green olives, cola and dried herbs, while the oak is subtle, even though it's all new. Grows more interesting as it warms in the glass, and the alcohol level is a moderate 13.6%. Blended from all five classic Bordeaux varieties, it will improve in the bottle over the next eight years.",91,75,California,Spring Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Very strong white peach and lemon blossom aromas meet with roasted chicken, honeysuckle and chamomile on the nose of this bottling. Apple, pear and nectarine show on the palate, as does fresh cherimoya, graphite and more white peach toward the finish.",91,52,California,Monterey,Chardonnay
US,"Very strong, ripe and extracted. The word massive comes to mind. So packed with blackberry and blueberry preserves, it's almost a food group in itself.

Defines the modern style, and shows that Alexander Valley doesn't have to take second place to Napa Valley when it comes to Cabernet Sauvignon.",94,64,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Very sweet-smelling, like putting your nose in a bowl of sugar, followed by aromas of ripe pineapple juice, this smooth Sauvignon Blanc from the Michael David folks is sweet through and through.",84,14,California,Lake County,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"Very tannic and dry, especially for a 2007 Cabernet, not showing the fatness and opulence of that acclaimed vintage. There are some buried treasure blackberry and cassis flavors, but the wine is so tough, you have to wonder if it will ever come around.",87,49,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Very tasty, this medium-bodied version puts forward bright raspberry and ripe red cherry aromas and flavor. Not too big or bold, it's well-balanced with acidity and moderate tannins to bolster the fruit flavors.",88,23,California,Sierra Foothills,Cabernet Franc

The palate shows some grassiness, Mexican lime and an interesting warmth on the back end, proving quite lean and sharp.",88,28,California,Edna Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Very tight now, with minerally, yeasty flavors of lees and unintegrated smoky new oak. High acidity adds to the impression of austerity. Difficult to appreciate in its infancy, but this elegant, layered, complex Chard should begin to blossom after 2008 and hold for several years.",89,26,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Chardonnay
US,"Very tight yellow-pear-skin aromas meet with lemon rinds, scratched lime skin, fragrant wet clay and very pithy aromas on this intriguing bottling. Once sipped, the body is steely in acidity and texture, like licking gunmetal, with a warmer stone-fruit element arising in the midpalate. It's a very interesting wine that will appeal to savvy palates.",90,22,California,Santa Maria Valley,Pinot Blanc
US,"Very unusual to get a newly released Cabernet from the 2004 vintage, especially one this good, at this price. At age six, it's fully mellow, with a silky mouthfeel framing flavors of cherries and blackberries that are starting to dry out and sweeten. There are also developing notes of mushrooms and earth. What a bargain, but only 800 cases were produced.",93,25,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,Very varietal aromas of sour cherry and cranberry lead to a fruit-filled flavorful palate. Light oak accents linger on the finish. It's a very pleasing example of the variety.,90,20,Washington,Wahluke Slope,Sangiovese

US,"Veteran winemaker Joel Aiken marches to a different beat from today's cult style, reverting to an older expression of Napa Valley Cabernet. This one is bone dry, tannic and tightly wound in acids. It will not offer much pleasure now, even after decanting.

US,"Vine Cliff consistently produces one of the best Chardonnays in Napa Valley, and here's another one.

Fine and fleeting in texture, yet remarkably powerful in presence.",89,30,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling
US,"Vintage Selection has long been the winery's age-worthy 100% Cabernet. Although this has an alcohol content that's higher than in the past, it should still reward cellaring.

US,"Well-aged, light gold, and bottled in a Burgundy bottle for reasons unknown, this off dry high-acid effort should be consumed within the next year or two.

US,"What a fine, beautiful wine this is. Shows every graceful aspect of a modern Napa Cab, from the perfectly ripened fruit to the unbelievably fine tannins and application of oak.

Best now, even without decanting, and through 2014.",96,85,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"What a great follow-up to the 2009 vintage. You can put this in the cellar with entire confidence that it will age for likely 10‚Äì20 years, and actually improve. At nearly three years of age, it's rich and vibrant with black currants, blueberries and dark chocolate, and a big hit of sweet oak. But the tannins are impossible, locking the mouth down with astringency. It's a pity that most of the 2l,064 bottles produced will probably be opened too young.",94,140,California,Pine Mountain-Cloverdale Peak,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"What a great improvement the '06 is over the '05. It's considerably lower in alcohol, and much more balanced and crisp.

US,"What a great wine for the price. It's made from various Napa mountain vineyards, and shows concentrated blackberry and black currant flavors, wrapped into superfine Napa tannins that go down with silky smoothness.

US,"What a pretty wine. Made for drinking soon, it shows impeccable balance in the finely ground tannins, moderate alcohol and deft touch of oak. Feels soft and complex in the mouth, carrying flavors of berries, herbs, mocha and sandalwood. Easy to find, with 16,056 cases produced.",88,24,California,Napa Valley,Merlot
US,"What a superb Zin this is. It's a robust, luscious wine, that's thrillingly rich with notes of wild blackberries and raspberries, red licorice, cola and crushed peppercorn, along with a subtle jacket of smoky oak. The grapes come from a small vineyard in the heart of Dry Creek Valley. Drink now‚Äì2018.",93,38,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
US,"What you see is what you get, a simple, affordable Cabernet, with decent berry, spice and oak flavors. It's dry and balanced.",84,10,California,California,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"What's so interesting about this wine is the savory minerality, racy acidity and extreme dryness that make it completely different from 99% of the Sauvignon Blancs in California. It's not without fruit. You'll find mouthwatering Meyer lemons, sweet Kaffir limes and spicy figs. Just beautiful, and a real sommelier's wine.",91,22,California,Russian River Valley,Sauvignon Blanc
US,"What's so nice about this Cab is its balance and delicacy, without the heaviness that can mar a more alcoholic wine. It shows polished flavors of cherries, blackberries, cola and cedar, with a long, fine finish of cassis liqueur. Really an elegant sipper, this wine is best now and for a couple years.",90,55,California,Yountville,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"When California Riesling succeeds, it's because of wines like this, which hails from a well-farmed, cool-climate region. The two most important varietal elements, racy acidity and subtle flavor, both are here. The latter suggest peaches, Meyer lemons and wildflowers, with a rich undertow of stony minerals, and the finish is wonderfully bone dry. What a great restaurant wine.",90,18,California,Santa Lucia Highlands,Riesling
US,"When Dry Creek gets it right, few wineries anywhere can beat their Zins. Somers Ranch is in the eastern hills, where it gets the full benefit of the afternoon sun. The wine is impressive in ripe blackberries, currants, licorice and cocoa, but maintains a beautiful structure, with soft, fine tannins and just-in-time acidity.",92,34,California,Dry Creek Valley,Zinfandel
US,"When this hilly vineyard Cab first came out, it was very good, but quality has slipped over the years. The '04 is perfectly decent in oak-infused blackberry and currant flavors and rich tannins, and it may even improve for a few years.",87,34,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Where Girard's estate Cab is beautiful now, their Diamond Mountain bottling is one for the cellar. Veteran winemaker Marco DiGiulio has applied his considerable experience, with classic results. The wine is marked by firm tannins that make it astringent and sticky. But underneath all that is an explosion of currant, plum, licorice, chocolate and spicy curry flavor that dazzles. Should easily age for a long time in a proper cellar. Production was a paltry 325 cases, and worth the search.",95,75,California,Diamond Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon

Nearly 20% of Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot in the blend contribute to a nobility of structure and firm tannins, but the briary, brambly fruit and spiciness are all Zin. Decadent to drink now with short ribs.",91,30,California,Napa Valley,Zinfandel

Lovely now and over the next six years.",91,28,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
US,"While the winery's regular 2010 Diamond Mountain Cab is a barrel selection, this Estate Vineyard selection consists of ‚Äúonly the darkest, most extracted lots,‚Äù from the winery's various vineyards, according to the winemaker. That's exactly what you get, an inky wine, it's huge on the palate with blackberries, currants and dark chocolate, augmented by plenty of new French oak.

Cedar, currant and a sweetness of vanilla fan out on the palate.",86,20,California,Napa Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Winemaker Steve Goldfield brings the same deft touch he displays with Pinot Noir to this lush, elegant wine.

This is consistently one of the best Zins from the RRV.",92,40,California,Russian River Valley,Zinfandel
US,"Winemaker Tim Stevens' dark, subtle, beautifully proportioned wines glide across the palate like Apollo Ono dancing with the stars.

An ancient grape from the north of Italy and Austria",89,20,California,San Luis Obispo County,Lagrein

US,"With 4% Petit Verdot added for body and color, this Cab is otherwise on the brighter side of red fruit and acidity, nicely balanced and approachable in cranberry, cassis and a wink of violet.

It's penetrating and deliciously persistent.",91,15,New York,Finger Lakes,Riesling

US,"With a touch more depth and complexity than Six Sigma's other offering, this wine has ripe melon and fig flavors, full body and a creamy texture that make it a standout.

US,"With elaborate oak, concentrated fruit, dense tannins and exquisite balance, this tiny production Cabernet‚Äîthe winery's first-ever reserve‚Äîdemands to be cellared. It's completely dry and rich in blackberries, black currants, baking chocolate, anise and minerals. It feels dramatic from the start, like the opening notes of a great symphony or rock song. Cellar it for at least eight years, and it could age well beyond that.",94,125,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"With excellent concentration and a firm, dry texture, this is a serious wine that's tempting to drink now but will be better after 2018.

It will be waiting in the cellar for a good occasion with a choice cut of meat.",91,30,California,Mendocino,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"With exceptional dryness, acidic crispness and minerality, this Chardonnay can be described as Chablis-style. The structure is certainly noble, and nobody would ever accuse it of being a fruit bomb despite the rich pineapple tart and lemon drop flavors. Hard to predict its future, but probably best over the next four years.",93,40,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"With experience making Sangiovese in Italy, it's no wonder that winemaker Alessio Carli shines with the grape from this vineyard planted in rocky limestone 25 miles east of Monterey Bay. Aromas of leather, sour plums and cranberry lead into soft flavors of raspberry fruit, tar and espresso. Leathery grip gives it a slightly rustic feel as well.",91,18,California,Cienega Valley,Sangiovese
US,"With firm acidity and big tannins, this Cabernet is nowhere ready to drink. It shows an almost old-time Howell Mountain aggressiveness. It's also relatively low in alcohol, the kind of wine that Napa doesn't produce much of anymore. All signs, including an intense concentration of blackberries and stone fruits, are that it's an ager.

US,"With hints of barnyard and graphite accenting lush notes of blackberries, cassis and ceder, this distinctly Old World-style Cabernet is fascinatingly complex, yet undeniably simple in style.

US,"You need to give this 100% Cabernet Sauvignon time in the cellar. It's nowhere near ready, even if you're used to tannins in your reds. It's hard as nails in astringency. This 2006 vintage doesn't have quite the concentration of the ‚Äò05, but there are some lovely black cherry and black currant flavors, and they should begin to blossom in 4 or 5 years.",90,98,California,St. Helena,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"You won't miss the presence of oak in this Chardonnay. It's brilliantly forward, ripe and savory, with orange, mango and lime flavors. Natural acidity and a creamy, leesy richness bring extra layers of appeal, and the finish is thoroughly dry.",92,27,California,Green Valley,Chardonnay

US,"You'd never confuse this with a California Chard. Well, Anderson Valley, maybe. It's a cool-climate wine. Aromas of fresh, cold green apples, with what seems like an overlay of buttery oak. Brilliantly dry and crisp in the mouth. It's all about acidity here; flavors are secondary. Clean as a whistle, edgy, a nervously racy wine that practically cries out for shellfish.",88,17,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Chardonnay
US,"You'd never guess that this was rocking it so hard with 16.3% alcohol, as this wine achieves balance in the face of such boozy contents. The nose holds a blackberry core with rusty, spicier edges of star anise. These are followed by a palate of black cherry and cedar, with enough tannins to ensure evolving drinking until at least 2018.",90,50,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
US,"You'll find an herbal note in this wine, suggesting sweet green peas and dried herbs alongside riper touches of blackberry and cherry. Although it's pretty tannic, it's soft, making it drinkable now. It could be ideal with shepherd's pie.",87,28,California,Sonoma County,Cabernet Franc
US,"You'll find crisp Monterey acidity on this wine, but otherwise, it's candied in style with flavors of raspberries and cola, along with raisins turning up in the finish.",82,29,California,Monterey County,Cabernet Franc
US,"You'll find lots of upfront blackberry, black currant, roasted meat and cedar flavors in this dry Malbec. It's a little soft, but easy to drink now, especially with beef.",86,20,California,Santa Barbara County,Malbec
US,"You'll find oaky aromas and flavors of buttered toast, sweet vanilla and butterscotch on this Chardonnay. The underlying fruit is pure and intense, suggesting ripe apricots, green apples and limes, brightened by a streak of acidity.",86,14,California,Arroyo Seco,Chardonnay

US,"You'll find plenty of blackberry, cherry, currant and oak flavors in this 100% Cabernet. Aging in 100% new French oak gives it that fancy veneer of sweet toast. At six-years old, the wine has green, almost vegetal notes that seem unlikely to resolve with further bottle age. Drink up.",85,50,California,Carmel Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"You'll find plenty of tart green gooseberries in this dry Sauvignon Blanc. Yet there are also ripe grapefruit, kiwi and papaya flavors. It's a refreshingly clean wine for drinking now.",87,21,California,Napa Valley,Sauvignon Blanc

US,"You'll find savory blackberry, cherry, currant and cola flavors in this dry blend of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot and Cabernet Franc, as well as smoky, oaky notes. The problem is excessive softness. There's no proper structure, so it all collapses in mid-palate.",85,30,California,Carmel Valley,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"You'll find some mint and vegetal aromas and flavors side-by-side with intense, sugary sweet blackberry jam ones in this Zin. It's unbalanced to that degree.",82,28,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel
US,"You'll find sweet and sour flavors in this wine, like in a LifeSaver lemon candy. The best part is the acidity, which is tart, and keeps the wine balanced.",82,12,California,Lodi,Viognier
US,"You'll find the hard tannins associated with Diamond Creek's Cabs, as well as an iodine, metallic brittleness to this wine. The combination of the two makes this as tough as any young Napa Valley Cabernet could be. However, the core is potent, suggesting intensely concentrated black currants and blackberries, reduced to their elemental essence. Do not touch this wine before 2020, and it should still be going strong in 2030.",95,200,California,Diamond Mountain District,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"You'll find tons of blackberry, cherry, raspberry, orange zest, chocolate and spice flavors in this dry wine, but it's no mere fruit store. With polished tannins and fine Carneros acidity, it achieves an elegant balance. Drink now.",90,35,California,Carneros,Merlot
US,"You'll have to go far and wide to find a bigger, richer California Chardonnay. It's enormous, offering an explosion of tropical fruit, citrus and apricot, brightened by crisp acidity. Despite the power, the wine maintains elegance and balance. This is one of the few Chards that will take bottle age, gradually losing fruit. Drink now‚Äì2018.",93,30,California,Santa Maria Valley,Chardonnay
US,"You'll love the brightness and liveliness of this wonderfully drinkable Cabernet. Sometimes these rich wines can be heavy, but this one combines tartness with its elaborate blackberry jam, anise and cedar wood flavors, which makes it sing. Perfect now with a great steak, and should age well for up to eight years.",93,47,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"You'll need lots of rich, gooey cheese and oily meats to eat with this wine, because it's pretty harsh and thin on its own. Something like a cheeseburger will help it a lot.",83,12,California,Central Coast,Shiraz
US,"You'll want to age this wine for a good 6‚Äì8 years, because right now it's rather tough in tannins, and the fruit and oak have not married. Nonetheless it's quite a good wine. Shows complex layers of blackberries, currants and caramelized oak. Lifts Alexander Valley Cabernet above its usual level into noteworthy.",93,150,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon

Shows complex layers of blackberries, currants and caramelized oak. Lifts Alexander Valley Cabernet above its usual level into noteworthy.",93,150,California,Alexander Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"You'll want to age this wine for a while because the tannins and acids are juvenile, and the 85% new oak hasn't been integrated into the fruit. But it's a stunningly good wine whose most notable feature is brilliant blackberry, cherry and currant fruit, with notes of chocolate-covered raisins. Give it until 2009, and it should continue for another 3 or 4 years.",91,90,California,Rutherford,Cabernet Franc
US,"You'll want to enjoy this wine while it is expressing the freshness of youth. Fruit flavors pop out, a bright mix of apple, citrus and pear. A light suggestion of toast delicately frames the finish. It offers medium concentration and excellent balance throughout.",88,20,Oregon,Oregon,Pinot Blanc
US,"You'll want to give this vigorous young Cab time in the cellar to come around. It's tannic and closed now, and the blackberry and cherry fruit has a primary fruit jamminess that wants to develop some bottle-aged characteristics. Give it until 2017 to begin to come around.",92,65,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"You'll want to stash this young Cab away for a while because it's too closed and tannic now for enjoyment. But it has a very rich, concentrated core of cassis flavor and is dry and balanced in acidity. Should negotiate the next 6‚Äì8 years easily, and maybe longer.",91,55,California,Napa Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Young and fresh, it has excellent minerality. The fruit is light and lively, leaning toward grapefruit, green apple and a smidge of just-ripe melon. It's a lovely summer sipper, with a few good years of life ahead.",87,16,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"Young and fresh, this 100% Malbec has tight, spicy, peppery fruit that leads into a surprisingly long finish. It's not tricked up with oak, but the sharp young berry flavors evolve in the mouth and bring on clove, wintergreen and mint, which resonate through a lingering finish. Though the fruit lacks flesh, it doesn't hold back on pure flavor, and promises good things ahead for this new vineyard.",89,30,Washington,Yakima Valley,Malbec
US,"Young and light, with a nutty coating around flavorful layers of pear and yellow apple, this wine has a crispness that remains balanced throughout. A good food wine, with enough acidity to stay refreshing, this is a fine, fairly larger-production white built to impress.",91,50,California,Sonoma Coast,Chardonnay
US,"Young and lightly spicy, this brings crisp flavors of Asian pear to the forefront. It's a straightforward wine, with just a dash of white pepper adding an interesting flavor note.",86,13,Oregon,Willamette Valley,Pinot Gris
US,"Young and still a bit yeasty, with the flavors still integrating. The toasty barrel and bourbon flavors are matched to medium acids and stone fruits. This needs more time in the bottle to show all its strengths.",91,20,Washington,Walla Walla Valley (WA),Chardonnay
US,"Young and still coming out of its cocoon, this Home Ranch Cab is a wall of tannins waiting to break free into nuances of cassis, cherry, mint and dark chocolate. Plenty structured, it's made in small quantities and is worth aging until 2024‚Äì2034 for those tannins to soften around their edges.",87,65,California,Livermore Valley,Cabernet Sauvignon
US,"Young and still integrating its lush barrel flavors, this savory Chardonnay should hit its peak in another two or three years. The fruit is full and fleshy, a generous mix of citrus, stone and tropical fruits. Creamy and nicely textural in the mouth, it has the grip and acidity to keep it poised and detailed through a long finish.",91,28,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Chardonnay
US,"Young and tight, this new release from a founding Oregon viticulture family already shows good balance in a smooth, buttery, somewhat oaky style. The fruit flavors coat the tongue and roll into the seductive barrel notes. Let this bottle age until early 2016 and it will really shine.",90,45,Oregon,Dundee Hills,Chardonnay
US,"Young and visibly spritzy, this appealing wine bursts forth with scents of lemon tea and orange blossoms, followed by flavors of orange soda, candied pineapple and stone fruits. It's round and fruity, definitely sweet, but kept lively with plenty of acid and that tongue-tickling spritz.",90,24,Oregon,Ribbon Ridge,Riesling

US,"Young and yeasty, this seemingly off-dry Viognier rounds out in the mouth with appealing scents and flavors of lemon, lime, jasmine and honey.",89,20,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Viognier
US,"Young, intense and briary, with summer herb notes of anise framing ripe, spicy blackberries. Oak adds a rich, deft touch of sweet char. The tannins are considerable and brooding, giving this dry young wine an astringent tightness. Shows all the hallmarks of ageability. 45% Merlot, 43% Petit Verdot 7% Cabernet Franc, 5% Cabernet Sauvignon.",94,55,California,Calistoga,Bordeaux-style Red Blend
US,"Young, tight, firm fruit, with nuances of blueberry dominating. Tannic, dry and tight, it's well made with excellent structure and balance. Tight right now, high-toned and tart, but with a good, long life ahead.",91,28,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel
US,"Young, vibrant and fresh, this wine's crisp acidity frames pineapple and tropical fruit flavors, with a slight hint of botrytis in the form of golden apricot and honey. There's lots of evident oak, creating a buttered toast note, while its minerality makes it complex. Vastly rich, if a little lacking in subtlety. Drink now.",92,42,California,Russian River Valley,Chardonnay
US,"Your basic everyday Zinfandel, with candied raspberry and cherry fruit, toast and pepper flavors, as well as a streak of green unripeness.",82,11,California,California,Zinfandel

US,"Zesty acidity and an enticing slick of honeycomb lend varietal character to this lavishly floral, peachy white. So spry and revitalizing, with a salty tang of minerality, it's surprisingly still the only Chenin Blanc grown in New York.",91,28,New York,North Fork of Long Island,Chenin Blanc
US,"Zesty aromas of fresh lemon and tangerine peel add vibrancy to this brisk, dry Riesling. It's elegant and fruity, and it offers loads of crisp green-apple and pear flavors that are accented by dusty minerality.

US,"Zin fans should pick up this winery's entire range of small-batch takes on the grape, as they are all fascinating. This one is lighter in color and offers fresh blackberry and chopped black-sage aromas. The palate is very easy to sip, with salt and cherry flavors creating a food-friendly version of an often overpowering grape.",89,38,California,Paso Robles,Zinfandel

US,"Zinfandel by another name, this appealing wine has cola and cherry aromas, plus snappy cherry-candy and sweet prune flavors. It's full-bodied and has lively acidity, a silky texture and lingering finish.",87,24,California,Clear Lake,Primitivo
US,"Zinfandel fans will celebrate this powerfully ripe, exuberant wine.

US,"Zinfandel has been a Forgeron specialty for the past decade. Done in a ripe, though not too Porty style, it's more like a Dry Creek wine. Flavors of red and blue berries are annotated with a note of sweet grain, giving it a California twist, with Washington verve and acidity.",89,30,Washington,Columbia Valley (WA),Zinfandel
US,"Zinfandel is not usually a wine you have to age, but this one does need four years or so in the cellar. It's bone dry and quite good, with classic wild berry, tobacco, grilled meat and spice flavors, but it's pretty tannic. Has the depth and balance to blossom by, say, 2015.",90,27,California,Sonoma County,Zinfandel
